    "The only way to get the current market rate is to get a different job. The days of working hard and getting ahead at one place are dead and gone.",
    "Yeah, unfortunately OPs story is insanely common for men and women these days. Then when OP leaves the company is going of have to hire someone for 20k more then what they were paying her to do a worse job, instead of paying her accordingly.\n\nOP get on indeed yesterday",
    "I left my previous job three years ago after being there for 15 years. I‚Äôd asked for raises so many times, and they gave minimal increases stating that everyone was getting the same (definitely not true!). My new job was an immediate $40K raise, a $5k signing bonus, and an extra week of vacation. When I told my previous boss I was leaving, he wanted to make a counter offer, but I told him not to bother. It would have probably been insulting anyway!  So glad I left, but I wish I hadn‚Äôt taken so long to consider it.",
    "Yeah, i had to leave a job after being lied to for a year about an upcoming pay raise / promotion.\n\nOnly when it came, it was literally a 1.1% raise.  when I asked what happened to the 15% raise that I'd been hearing about for  almost a year, the boss said \"management gave me a pool of money to spread around the team.\" and he added \"I didn't even take any for myself\" and finally \"there's nothing else i can do.\"\n\nI started looking immediately, found a new job and put my notice in within a week.\n\nThe boss came back to me all shocked and asked what it would take to get me to stay.\n\nYeah, we had that conversation a week earlier.",
    "Why are they always \"shocked\"?",
    "Because the vast majority of people don't quit their jobs due to fear of unemployment and fear of failure.\n\nAnd many of the ones who threaten don't end up actually leaving because navigating the current job market is difficult (trade dependent) \n\nSo it legitimately is shocking when someone actually does quit especially when it's someone who has been the company workhorse for years. \n\nIt shouldn't be... (you knew you were paying under market value) but the odds are against actually losing someone you value so it always catches them off guard when they realize that NO their valuable employee does not in fact value Safety, loyalty, or peace of mind over ambition and money. \n\nEVERY SINGLE BILLIONAIRE makes this calculation even when it's abundantly obvious they're being short sighted. The Dallas Cowboys traded away their edge tackler Micah Parsons because they thought they could lowball him because he WANTED TO STAY even though they're in an industry where not only are your employees guaranteed to get raises if ANYONE wants them but also where the cost of signing people gets more expensive the longer you wait to sign them due to inflated salaries...\n\nWhich is why now they desperately need an edge rusher and are considering trading valuable assets to acquire an even more expensive edge rusher... but hey at least they saved money by not paying a guy who was loyal to them what he thought he deserved.\n\nThe cowboys were somehow shocked that Parsons was going to refuse to play for them and had no backup plan and that's in an industry where he's practically guaranteed to get more money if he walks... why would the average run of the mill billionaire not be shocked when an employee walks for more money in tighter markets?",
    "Because they think they hold all the cards. And (American) employment law supports that. The only card workers have to play is GOODBYE and it's a difficult one.",
    "> My new job was an immediate $40K raise, a $5k signing bonus, and an extra week of vacation. When I told my previous boss I was leaving, he wanted to make a counter offer, but I told him not to bother.\n\nüëëüëëüëëüëë",
    "Yeah unfortunately our current economy doesn't reward loyalty to the company at all. The opposite, if anything. Even absent sexism, people can be hired at different economic times and you'll never bridge that gap through the tiny incremental raises that are standard. I've also seen SOOOO many people promoted at a fraction of the pay anyone else would have earned, usually given a pat on the head about \"being a team player\" or told times are tough right now. Always happens to the nicest folks - employers know they can typically give you \"a slight bump\" over your current salary as part of your \"promotion\" whereas someone hired externally would have been $50K more. They incentivize you to leave.",
    "It's not just loyalty. These days, most employers don‚Äôt even reward excellent work, and since I‚Äôm not from the US, it‚Äôs not just an exclusive issue there.\n\nIn my experience, the benefits of doing your work efficiently and well are getting more work thrown your way. If you say ‚Äûno more\" at one point to protect your health, you're either labeled as egotistical or accused of not being a team player. It‚Äôs no wonder that the burnout cases keep increasing year after year. \n\nAnecdotally, I currently work for a company with 100 employees. In my recent yearly evaluation I presented data showing that I save the company over 100k every year compared to my predecessor. I also showed that, even with my occasional raises, my real wage (accounting for inflation) is even less than when I started five years ago. They don't care. It's the same situation you're describing here. I'm not irreplaceable, no one really is, but the cost to the business of replacing me would be extremely high. They could factually double my salary and still save money compared to that. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI'm currently looking for a new job. It‚Äôs a bit of an annoying timing rn because the Trump-esque shenanigans, for the most part, have made the job market rather poor, even over here.",
    "It used to be that females put up with discrimination in pay and advancement because the company offered health care & pension benefits, matching funds etc. that made it worthwhile not to rock the boat. Those benefits disappeared as did the promote from within model that no longer is in existence. Only way to keep ahead o the game is to switch jobs.",
    "I left my last job for my current with a roughly 85% increase in money but I lost dedicated sick time and about 2 weeks of paid vacation. Then the pandemic hit and time off kind of didn‚Äôt matter.",
    "If you like the company you're staying at, and think they might be somewhat reasonable and in need of you, you can always say \"I've been getting contacted to do the same job elsewhere for $20k more. I love it here but my family could really use the additional money. I know your my boss, but putting that aside what would you suggest in this situation\". This can be changed around based on the actual relationship, but it lets them know you know you're underpaid and will likely leave if it's not corrected. They know they'd need to spend 20k more anyway to replace you, so if they would rather you than someone new there is a good chance they could make it happen, or above that since you could get that elsewhere. It also shows immense respect for both your employer and boss instead of anger.",
    "Yeah I knew a woman who got multiple raises this way. Other places were literally trying to hire her away, in her case, and her employer kept matching the offers.",
    "Hard disagree. Good advice in a perfect world but not the one we're in.\n\nMost places will consider this 'disloyalty' and it's likely to be held against you at some point even if they match your ask. Plus, what if they say \"No\" and you have nothing concrete from another firm?",
    "This just happened to me, I quit my job (because I literally had to do PAYROLL and enter my boss‚Äôs $30,000 raise when I got a $2,000 one even though I had taken on a bunch of extra responsibility, it was the worst day and I was just like I can‚Äôt fucking do this anymore) and they rehired my role for almost $20k more. It‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I even want anything to do with payroll/accounting/bookkeeping anymore, I‚Äôm probably pivoting careers because it‚Äôs so soul crushing to see it in action intimately day to day. Seeing the salary discrepancies is ROUGH and I can tell you first hand that it comes down to how pushy people are, how hard they advocate for themselves, and that the negotiation model for salary is inherently biased towards exactly who you think it is. \n\nAfter working with payroll for 10 years, I am a staunch advocate against companies saying ‚Äúyou just need to negotiate‚Äù because SO many people come from backgrounds where they‚Äôve been told they will straight up get fired if they ask for more, like how OP is crashing out right now about getting fired for this very real inequity between her and her male coworker. And that‚Äôs not some imagined thing, women and poc absolutely will get fired or at least ignored in some cases when they ask for more money. In my experience, many of the people who have a lot of job creep absolutely end up being the least paid and it‚Äôs because they are being taken advantage of, even if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood‚Äù company. So for anyone reading this that feels like they are underpaid for how much they have taken on, or underpaid for the market rate of their role, or feel like they are being gaslit by their company about pay - trust your gut because I would say 99% chance that you are indeed and that you would be sick to see all of the payroll information for the company. And good companies do this too, my last company did seem like they cared about staff but they still took advantage of me. They will do it if you let them, don‚Äôt ever take on more long term responsibilities without negotiating more pay.",
    "I‚Äôm based in Germany ( I guess you might be from the U.S.) and wanted a reality check.\nI joined my consulting firm in mid 2022 at around ‚Ç¨57k (no bonus).\nHere‚Äôs how it went after that:\n\t‚Ä¢\t2023: same base, but added ~10% annual bonus\n\t‚Ä¢\t2024: base increased slightly to ~‚Ç¨58k\n\t‚Ä¢\tFeb 2025: told that the next raise would take effect mid-year\n\t‚Ä¢\tMid-2025: base increased to ~‚Ç¨62k, bonus still ~10%\n\t‚Ä¢\tLater in 2025: promoted to a senior-level consultant, but no new raise since one had just kicked in\n\nSo I‚Äôm at about ‚Ç¨68k total now, roughly keeping pace with inflation but not ahead of it. Meanwhile, I the client is billed about 50% more for my work now that I‚Äôm senior.\n\nDoes it make sense that client rates rise that much while my pay barely moves? And that because I had a pay raise come into effect couple of months before my promotion? To my dismay I didn't negotiate any pay raises after I was inducted into the role. I feel I am being underpaid and must make a move. However, I know I am also to blame since I never raised any question about salary even when I was told of my promotion without any pay raises after.",
    "Now that you have seniority, I suggest also looking around on job market. 68k for a consultant seems extremely low as a base.",
    "Yes, think so as well. Btw 62K is base and with 10% bonus it's 68K. No chance I am going to get a big raise if I didn't get one on promotion since my last pay was already at top end of my previous role and already spilled me into lower pays for the senior role üò¨",
    "I feel this so hard. Used to work in public accounting as a CPA. Was doing an audit of a company and saw the name of someone I went to high school with. They also worked in accounting but weren‚Äôt certified. They made $40k more than I did. I was in a foul mood for days. Working in accounting and seeing salaries can be crushing.",
    "Yeah. When you can see the salary of the 18 & 21 year olds that were hired for the same position as you with zero experience, and you know they lied on their resume. They were also vetted by a higher up who doesn't seem to care. When my boss requested that I get equal pay, they said they were going to shift around positions and my boss would be the new guy that hired all these kids. \n\nI've been around and I knew what that meant. No higher pay, plus I now would train all these kids with my experience that I earned on my own. So I called for a reference from a friend and ended up getting a job offer with higher pay, more than those unexperienced 18-21 year olds, which they keep hiring now to keep up with the workflow I guess. But it's none of my business because I left. I miss some of my friends, but I don't miss the place. It's become toxic and I've heard that things in my previous dept aren't good. \n\nBusinesses have become stupid. They spend big money for guys or talkers, but not for those with talent. When you lose talent you get a reputation eventually. Then all you'll have are those that get paid to do nothing.",
    "Ugh I hate that for you (and us). I always thought there should be a support group for people that work with salary information because it‚Äôs so demeaning and hard to stay impartial, but of course staying impartial or at least heavily masking any kind of feelings about seeing that you‚Äôre underpaid relatively are a HUGE part of accounting/HR. Like my professionalism is tied to not ever saying anything about the salary information I‚Äôm seeing, even to other underpaid people who have access to it as well, but it‚Äôs so difficult when you have to see it in your face like that and you know that there‚Äôs zero context that makes it more understandable‚Ä¶ makes me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me for not being able to not be upset by it. \n\nIt was especially hard for me once I got to a higher level where I was sitting in on a lot of salary and hiring discussions and had to see that certain people (men mostly) are just given the salary they ask for without any question or pushback and are super confident in doing so, whereas women will be gaslit and pushed back against when they try to negotiate, which is enough for most people to back down if you have been told your whole life that you‚Äôll be fired for even asking about pay. The only time I have ever been paid correctly for the role I had was when I politely let my job know that I was leaving due to being underpaid (after them always gaslighting me about it before that) and they somehow magically pulled a $20k raise out of nowhere immediately. I wish I was able to bring that energy all of the time but it‚Äôs something I really struggle with.\n\nEdited to add: it‚Äôs also so discouraging that certifications/qualifications don‚Äôt seem to change this dynamic. Having a CPA should absolutely mean that you are being paid accordingly given how much time, schooling and money it takes to become certified. How frustrating.",
    "This whole discussion is depressing. I am the opposite of pushy and have spent my whole life giving 110% while being grateful for whatever they decided to give me. Ugh i do not like society.",
    "Well, reach out to your professional contacts and see if there are openings available where you could get a referral.",
    "Start interviewing and get the other job offer with a firm value on paper. With that job offer in your pocket ask your manager you raise your pay to $90k in the next two days or you'll walk.¬†\n\n\nYou're an asset to the company who is literally training people, which means you should be promoted in title even if you had the same pay, but no you're doing better and more work for less pay.¬†",
    "If you go through all the work of getting another job ... take it and leave. Why would you want to continue to work for an organization that's been underpaying you for so long?",
    "Especially a company that you asked for raises and they blamed budget and only acquiesced when you gave an ultimatum.",
    "You will also be on the short list when cuts come around, even if you are an asset, at a lot of companies.",
    "Yeah, companies really don‚Äôt like to be put in a position like that and they feel you do it once you will do it again and are a flight risk.",
    "Imagine how good it would feel if they offered the raise and you left anyways.",
    "You should (almost) never do this. Many companies will identify you as a \"flight risk\" if you do this they will give you the money for now and also start looking for someone they can replace you with for cheaper. \n\nIf you get a better offer at a different company, and it's for work that you want to do... Take it.",
    "This. Almost never accept the counter. There are reasons you're looking, and they don't magically disappear if you accept a raise. \n\nThe only time you'd legitimately consider a counter is the rare circumstance when some other company in your line of work offers you a job unprompted (example X says you're really good and we want you, here's an offer) and the offer is too good to pass up, but you genuinely do not want to leave where you currently are for whatever reason (like your current full time remote for example, but this potential role is fully in-person). \n\nThis is not one of those times.",
    "And even then, it can still be risky",
    "Yeah, or if you have some sort of extremely rare skillset that they could not easily replace.",
    "I agree if you find something that does both (pays more and better aligns with your goals), you should always take it. If it only pays better, though, it can be worth trying to get a counter offer if you otherwise like where you're at.\n\nIf you are (at least on paper) easily replaceable and relatively junior level, then yeah, unless you're absolutely certain that a counter offer isn't going to put crosshairs on you you should just leave. If the job you got an offer for isn't a perfect fit, you should keep looking.\n\nBut the more niche your skillset/field, the more advanced your training, or the more significant your institutional knowledge is, the more likely that an employer would prefer to keep you than find, hire and train your replacement. I don't know of too many places that will give you a raise without you asking for it, but there are places that would strongly prefer to give a good employee a raise than have to replace them.",
    "They know that a new employee is likely to run them $90k, they literally wrote it in the job posting. That's an empty threat they aren't making.",
    "So then the best case scenario here is that you start getting paid the same as everyone else, and you are still working for a company that tries to get away with paying women less for as long as they possibly can. \n\nOr, you could just move to the other company that's willing to pay you what you're actually worth right from the start.",
    "Every company starts out paying market rate and generally doesn't raise it unless forced to. Companies are amoral, you shouldn't hold grudges unless you have good reason to believe the current company is going to treat you worse than the new one, and in terms of giving bare-minimum CoL increases, that just doesn't happen in America anymore.",
    "I'm not talking about holding grudges against a company or anything like that. And I agree with you that companies are amoral. I'm just talking about understanding that the vast majority of companies do not have your best interest in mind, they have their own best interests in mind. As such, you should do the same. Operate with your own best interests in mind. \n\nThat means changing companies every now and then in order to maintain at the market rate, do not allow a company that has done something bad to you to make up for it by just paying you more money (if they are willing to truly acknowledge the bad thing they did, and take real action to not just resolve it but prevent it from happening again in the future, that's a different story).\n\nHave your own best interest in mind, don't do things that will put a target on your back. \n\nBut what do I know, I've only climbed the corporate ladder for the last 30 years making hiring decisions for at least the last 15. I've only seen this game play out dozens if not hundreds of times. \n\nLook out for yourself, don't look out for the company. If you have a better offer (and that does not mean just a higher salary, there is more to an offer than just the money, it also includes what kind of work, working conditions, other benefits, it's an entire package), then you should take the better offer. \n\nOne of the few times that you shouldn't take the better offer is if you just changed companies, you don't want your resume to make it look like you hop companies every 2 years because then new companies won't want to hire you because they know that they're going to spend the first 6 months training you and only get 1.5 years of work. But after 4 years? And with cause? Absolutely, take the better offer. \n\nWhen interviewing for those other positions, you also want to be careful how you describe the reason why you left the prior company. You don't want to come across as someone who's just ragging on the previous company, because however you speak about that previous company during the interview is how the new company is going to view how you're going to speak about them. \n\nIt's all a game, and the sooner you learn the rules of this game, the better.",
    "Don't assume companies/managers act rationally. Their horizon is \"whats best for me in 60 days\".",
    "This is wishful boomer talk. No one should do this. Just move to the other job. The old job would resent you and replace you for trying to \"force\" them, even if the pay was the same as Jake.",
    "The average extension of employment when accepting a counter offer from your current job is 12 months or less. Take the offer from the new employer and get on with it.",
    "And it‚Äôs a near certainty he‚Äôll balk at the raise, gaslight, and any manner of victim blaming. Hold fast and be ready for the new job you secured.",
    "This is a one way ticket to the company replacing you even if they pay up unfortunately",
    "Never do this.\n\nIf you are at that point and you just had to force their hand to give you more money then you are in a tough situation where they will hold it against you. Also you aren‚Äôt ever gonna see any raises after that where with the new company you might.",
    "That is bad professional advice.\n\nOP needs to speak to a labor-lawyer and prepare a case for FIRST requesting at least equal pay for equal work and THEN what to do if the company refuses.\n\n**KNOWING YOUR RIGHTS and OPTIONS IS THE FIRST STEP.**\n\nPrepping your arguments is the next step.\n\nThird, presenting the case, making the demands.\n\nFourth, after an answer, formulating a response.\n\nu/topplethiscake",
    "I've seen reddit horror stories of people trying this, and one HR ends up calling the other HR and finds out they're being pitted against each other. Second company rescinds the offer and the first company lets them go.",
    "Why would anyone ever tell the current employer the name of the next employer? Never tell anyone the place of your next offer. That is not their business.",
    "Short sweet and to the point. Getting them to correct the pay gap is one thing, and actually improving your conditions is another. \nJob hopping is the only way in 2025.",
    "This is correct. \n\nI discovered an junior male new hire got my same title and $35k more than me.\n\nI immediately addressed it and point blank asked, \"Am I fairly compensated with my male colleagues, taking into account that I have more experience and contribute significantly more revenue to the organization?\" I didn't get a straight response, but we both knew it was \"no.\" \n\nIt took 6 months before they came back with an adjustment.... 9% increase (and he got a 6% increase at the same time.)\n\nI said, \"Thanks. That's really disappointing because you and I both know what's really going on. I was hoping this company would make it right considering I'm delivering 90% of our team's revenue. This company externally brands itself on fairness, equity, inclusion... Yet I'm not seeing that be true from the inside. As such, I'm putting in my resignation.\"\n\nI had another job lined up making $40k more.",
    "Yes just as he is willing to hop to a different location. OP didn‚Äôt seem to consider that",
    "I think OP is considering the current climate though. The age of job hopping is put on hold, at least in some careers, as the job market is pretty rough.\n\nI am losing my job when my wife accepts a job in another state and man, the job market is thin out there. Searched within a 35 mile radius for web developer on several job sites and zero results came up.",
    "It's not like you quit your job when you are job hopping. You find another job...then quit. So \"current climate\" just makes it less likely to find the next job. You still have a job (for now).",
    "Does anyone even use that title anymore? It's almost always frontend developer/engineer now",
    "This is the most likely answer. Whenever I hire a new engineer I always do a level set on every other engineers‚Äô salary, and bump them up accordingly, including 5-10% bonus for tenure.",
    "It's this. Jake makes more than you _because_ he started more recently. I hire a lot of people. This is a basic fact of life. Salaries rarely keep up with inflation / market rates. The people who are keeping current are the ones who change jobs every two years. Especially if they happened to do so during a strong labor market like 2021.\n\nThose people also have more risk, because they don't have the seniority and institutional knowledge that someone who's been around longer has, and they have a bigger salary so you get more back if you're doing a layoff.\n\nIt's also possible that either you or Jake provided a desired range during the interview process that gave an anchor to the hiring manager to work from. You want to avoid this if you can, or do your research ahead of time. It's nice that some states require employers to post ranges now.\n\nGenerally speaking, companies aren't paying people more or less because they value them more or less. They're paying them the minimum amount it took to hire them and the minimum amount it might take to retain them.\n\nTalk to your coworkers about money. It's advantageous for employers that this is a taboo subject in America, but it's also illegal for them to forbid you from discussing it. In other countries (India, for example) everyone knows what everyone else makes.",
    "Jake only started 6 months after her. That short period of time is not the reason he‚Äôs being paid $20k more. \n\nI do agree that Jake could have had his stated range near the upper pay band while her stated was at the lower so they took full advantage when crafting her offer. \n\nAlways research pay bands for jobs and if you can‚Äôt find an estimated range for the company you‚Äôre applying for find it for a similar one. If you say you‚Äôll work for less than their hiring budget or on the lower end companies will jump on that with no remorse.",
    "This has a lot to do with negotiating. I ALWAYS stick to my guns at the top of a range while many people seem happy to just get a job. Well, companies are happy to pay you as little as you are willing to accept. This reads to me like Jake understood the assignment when he pursued this role.",
    "Yeah I‚Äôve turned downed roles because they wouldn‚Äôt meet my salary requirements. Know your worth.",
    "Or, he came from another job with a higher previous salary. There is a lot involved in what people are paid. It's exactly what the person at the top of this thread said: they pay what it takes to get you and give raises to retain you. It's really that simple.",
    "Which is why staying at a lower salary than you deserve costs you so much in the long run.  If you were leaving a job where you made $20k more than you do now you‚Äôd be starting from the $20k higher point in negotiating for the newer job.",
    "This bullshit is why we need unions. I know that my male coworkers are paid the same as I am at the same job level, because salary negotiation happens at the collective bargaining stage. There's no guesswork, no need to suddenly learn financial negotiation skills. You know exactly what salary you're applying for, because it's in the job listing. The system isn't flawless, but it's a whole lot better.",
    "He might simply have come in with a higher range request. 4 years ago was peak salary inflation..",
    "Exactly this. The situation is messed up, but I encourage all of my subordinates to apply to different jobs if they see it worth it. I won't take it persoanl and I know it's realistically the only way to see a decent raise. When it comes to internal promotions, our department offers very little compared to new hires. There's this one woman we want to bring on and she'll be earning more than half the existing staff at the same position despite having less experience, but that's just because those with us right now have mostly stayed at the same position and have relied on the small COLA raises each year.",
    "You say this if there isn‚Äôt global inflation and that jobs are being added to economies, which as far as I can tell, isn‚Äôt the case almost anywhere. I‚Äôm at 600 applications sent and had one interview from them. It‚Äôs really bad out there especially for younger people",
    "Hate to say it but you are probably going to have to leave. ¬† Either apply for the position in the other area with stipulation they pay you in the mid of the range. ¬† Or move companies. ¬†\nI had to (male). ¬†They hire you in and give measly 2-3% raises (definitely under 5%) citing budget constraints and tight market while hiring in new employees at higher rates. ¬†They save tons of money by employee retention. ¬†You would think they would value not having to train and the experience- but nope. ¬†They value it less by paying it less. ¬† And then cry and moan they can‚Äôt keep good talent.

Companies regularly let employee raises fall below market rate increases. So when you were hired at 58k that may have been the market rate or you may have accepted an offer on the lower end of the scale.\n\n\nAs the years have rolled on the market rate has increased significantly while you've been given tiny raises.\n\n\nPerhaps there's an element of sexism, but this story gets posted all the time with different genders.\n\n\nYou have a couple options. Number 1 top of the list is to start applying for jobs elsewhere. Nothing else is as likely to get you a higher salary.\n\n\nSecond, and it sounds like you've done this in the past, is to ask your company for a market rate adjustment. You now apparently even have an internal posting to prove the market rate is significantly higher than your salary.\n\n\nThird you apply for this newly posted position in your company.\n\n\nAt the very bottom of my list would be consulting a lawyer about a discrimination type case. I just don't think that route is going to get you anywhere. Unless there is a repeated and verifibly pattern of under paying women it's not going anywhere. One employee being paid less than new hires, isn't a case, and is in fact incredibly common.",

Jake happened to ride that wave. The new employee as you mentioned man or woman will probably also be able to ride that wave to a salary that‚Äôs higher than her or match with Jake just by virtue of being the new hire. \n\nWhat she shouldn‚Äôt do is go to HR using Jake‚Äôs salary as the premises for her argument as that will get thrown out on its head for a variety of reasons and never works. She should however take all those good reviews she has received and say your new position pays x% above mine for the experience I already have having worked here for all this time.

    "I think Radiolab has a episode about pay discrepancy like over a decade ago. Some men and fewer women negotiate aggressively to get better pay, whereas most women and some men tend not too. It's about negotiate and communication style with probably some elements of cultural conditions.¬†\n\n\nAs a result the only fair way to do things is completely transparent pay structures and every one knowing what everyone else makes. Government jobs work this way where your pay is determined by the level of the job and years in service.¬†",

Don‚Äôt be accusatory, frame it as you looking out for the company. Say to HR, ‚ÄúI have realized that I make less as an experience employee then you were willing to pay someone totally new to the company. I also know that I make significantly less than Jake and all the other people in my position, all of whom are men. The company is now very vulnerable to accusations of pay discrimination on the grounds of sex. I would like to see you rectify that situation and then the process pay me what I‚Äôm worth. Arguments about lack of revenue, etc., don‚Äôt hold water anymore, and the proof is in that job listing. It‚Äôs also in the fact that Jake was hired after I asked for salary correction.\n\nBefore you go, though, go to all of your other peeps who in the same position and ask them to share their salary history with you. What do they start, what were they offered, when did they get raises of how much.\n\nYou might also wait for the confrontation until after you‚Äôve spoken with an employment lawyer. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd bring up ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to a lawyer‚Äú in that very first conversation, but it would be good to have your legal options known and that pathway in place should you need it?\n\nI want to remind you that it is illegal to retaliate against you for sharing salaries when you do so for the purpose of negotiating, which this absolutely is. Of course, people and companies do illegal things, and they have to get corrected after the fact, but there is a labor department in your state, for now there is a federal labor department, although it is becoming more and more toothless\n\nThat is also why having that conversation with the lawyer ahead of time will be good, because the moment it starts to look like the company is going to retaliate against you for having this conversation or talking with people about their salaries, their lawyer can step in and apply some pressure to get them to do the right thing",

I went in and asked for an increase in salary that was more in line with my range, and I was denied. I was so devastated and humiliated, I quit on the spot. I didn‚Äôt have anything lined up and I found something quickly, but I went into that negotiation with 0 leverage. It would have worked better for me if I‚Äôd had tangible proof I was worth what I was asking.",

Why would they? They're paying you less than what a new hire would cost. It doesn't make sense to take the \"nuclear\" option right off the bat.",
    "If you go in with a salary range it‚Äôs pretty obvious you already have one foot out the door. The logical next step is that you would come back in with a job offer. You‚Äôre only hurting yourself by coming in unprepared to exit on your own terms, and the company doesn‚Äôt deserve that advantage. The only one who can get hurt in this situation is the employee.\n\nI‚Äôve done this twice so far, to the same company no less. I came in with an offer about double my salary and they were willing to beat it. I did the same a few years later with another offer that was about twice my salary and they wouldn‚Äôt do it - which was honestly fair at that point. The company was relatively nice/fair about the whole ordeal, but had I just come in with pointless metrics about average salaries they would have pointed out things like geographic cost of living, the supposed soft benefits the company offers, blah blah blah.\n\nIMO, if they won‚Äôt match then you SHOULD leave. So why not get the strongest bargaining tools and the safest fallback, assuming you want to stay if the pay goes up?",
    "No, this is NEVER the right option. \n\n1. If they do accept to pay you more, you are tagged as someone with one foot out the door.  And now they own you\n\n2. Never threaten to leave.  If you want to leave, then leave and never go back.\n\n3. The way you make the largest jumps in salary is by switching jobs / company.   Any organization is not going to go out of their way to pay more.  Once you are hired and are in \"the track,\" you get whatever the company is offering for raises.   Example.  Your salary may have been the going rate 4 years ago.  You have made the standard raise increases. However, the salary range jumped because of COLA (cost of living).   A good company and a good manager will always make sure that their people are in the middle of the range, so what happened to do does not happen.\n\nSource: 30 years of experience in corporate America",

    "This.  I was in a similar situation and found out that I was making 5% under the salary range‚Ä¶ excuse was that I went up too quickly and the raises were capped.  Translation.  I got screwed.  So I let my boss know that I was looking elsewhere, that I wouldn‚Äôt be staying where my work was valued at less than their own salary range, not with my years experience. Miraculously, they found the money.  I stayed for another year or so, but was much more amenable to recruiters.",
    "It is common for this to happen as they need to increase offers to get new people HOWEVER it can also be true that it‚Äôs a gender thing. This is also the reason many employers try to prevent employees from discussing their pay amongst each other (it‚Äôs illegal to disallow it though). You have new information, someone who appears to have the same qualifications as you, is making significantly more than you. Bring it up, tell your coworker and try to find out if there are actually any differences in qualifications or workload or go to hr and ask for a raise. Make them prove to you it isn‚Äôt a gender issue and if they can‚Äôt, consider a lawsuit for discrimination. In the meantime, start looking for new jobs because this employer might not value you as much as you value your job.",
    "some of this is also down to bad management. any manager who thinks they can prevent their employees from discussing their pay is living in an alternate reality. this is bound to happen and bound to cause resentment. an 18k difference between people of similar tenure, experience, and job performance is something that is bound to cause problems. my hr team would've alerted me about this every salary adjustment period until it was resolved.",
    "I feel this deeply. I was the star performer in my group / worked incredibly hard. my coworker who was not very focused mentioned his salary and I was floored because it was significantly more than mine. We had been hired at the exact same time. I waited until my performance review and mentioned a raise. I was given the exact same run around about budget constraints etc. I didn‚Äôt leave right away but I no longer put my heart into the job and did eventually leave. You can‚Äôt make them value you.",
    "There‚Äôs a reason the most common advice for career/salary progression is to jump ship and it‚Äôs because the internal machinations of companies never work out in the employee‚Äôs favor. New hires get current rates while old hires are relying on raises that barely keep up with inflation and maybe a slightly bigger bump from promotions. It never lines up with what a new company will pay or even what your current company would pay for years of experience and current market for new hires. You can talk to HR and payroll and your boss until you‚Äôre blue in the face and they‚Äôll justify it any way they can as to why they can‚Äôt increase you by such a large amount. The funny (depressing) thing is if you walked in and quit tomorrow, the job posting to replace you will probably show the salary range you‚Äôre asking them for.\n\n\nI would stop focusing so much on how or why it happened and put your energy towards your next steps. If market rate is currently closer to Jake‚Äôs salary for new employees that means someone at Senior level like yourself with about 5yrs of experience should be making even more. Start applying externally and get an offer letter with the salary you actually want. If you actually like your job and company, take that salary number to your current company and ask them if they‚Äôre willing to match it or you‚Äôre gone.\n\nGoing forward for the rest of your career, you need to realize that this is the way the game is played now. Prevailing advice seems to be 2yrs but I think that‚Äôs a little ridiculous as it takes most people at least a year to become fully useful at any given job unless you‚Äôre entering a role you have tons of experience in and the company operates like your previous one. 4 to 5 yrs is the sweet spot imo for starting to look externally and see how much you‚Äôre worth.",

    "As a boss, losing people and hiring replacements is very expensive both in money and time.\n\nComp should be normalized across positions with clear progression steps tied to expectations. If you (or your coworker) is meeting higher expectations they should get paid more.\n\nSometimes, and it's very job specific, market comp changes and part of a boss's job is to raise those rates so things like what happened to you doesn't occur.\n\nCheck salary.com, look at the median. That coupled with the new position you saw and your coworker statement is a lot of ammo. \n\nSome bosses don't prioritize this stuff and it drives me crazy because you know they're worried about their own comp.\n\nComp shouldn't be taboo to discuss. I won't tell someone what someone else makes, that's their decision to share. But we make it crystal clear as to what objective criteria is needed to be making x. \n\nI hate lazy managers who don't take care of this shit. Likely your boss is just happy to divert the budget elsewhere to new positions rather than normalize yours to market.",
    "While it's true that the only way to get a decent raise is to change jobs, $18k over you, even during the inflation of a few years ago, is a bit much at that level.\n\nI would take to an employment attorney. But it's not necessarily something they can prove. Most likely, you're looking at the threat of a lawsuit to get you a payment before you go find a new job.\n\nAlso, it may be worth confronting HR/your manager and mention that you were discussing wages... See if they say anything like \"you shouldn't talk about your wages wirh the other guy\"\n\nTelling you that is illegal. *That is, your boss is not allowed to tell you not to discuss wages.* That is literally against the law. (assuming you are in the usa).",
    "It's 100% discrimination. Companies do this to women all the time. You also can't \"negotiate\" like Jake did because of discrimination again. Women are seen in a negative light and they are less likely to be hired/promoted. The worse that happen to men is they simply don't get the additional money. They are not pushed out of the organization, like women. Google it. You'll see multiple studies confirming that \"negotiating\" is just their excuse to pay men more when they actually punish women for these behaviours. \n\nThe other issue is that when you go to a new company, they are likely to use the last amount you were paid as a way to justify paying you less again. I'd apply to a different company, increase the salary that I was making beforehand to be within that internal range, and stop doing extra things like organizing events. Women don't benefit in any way from these sorts of tasks. It's literally the equivalent of being asked to take notes or make coffee. They just see it as a sexist benefit to having a woman around, they don't pay you extra for these tasks they don't ask of men.",
    "To add to this, don't give in to answering how much you made at the previous job and even though it's even harder don't tell them how much you want. Neither is of relevance because they have their budget and either their offer matches your expectations (after some negotiation) or it doesn't. Problem is when you really need the job and honestly who doesn't, then you are less likely to be so firm about it.\n\nThe interviewers can tell instantly so you can't fake it and if you need work you might want to accept the first offer and at the same time keep looking and doing interviews. I know people who do that and end up quitting in their first weeks immediately because knowing they got a mediocre job that pays rent allowed them to be so much more confident.\n\nWhen they ask you anything about money you immediately tell them verbatim that you expect them to make an offer (of course remain respectful). Write down what you might say when you get pushback so you don't stumble when they inevitably ask why you don't want to answer. One of the answers might be \"because it's of no relevance, you got your budget so let's go from there.\" No need to ELI5 your answers either because these interviewers know exactly what's going on. If they keep playing dumb that's insulting and if they refuse to make an offer you can consider it a lost cause and ask to talk to someone in a supervisor role as you would like to give feedback immediately about how your interviewer(s) seem to be derailing the interview for no reason (again in a respecfull manner). (Another trick is to burn the first interviews on purpose and go in knowing it's practice and you were always going to waste their time.)\n\nYou are absolutely right that even though they expect this from a man you will often be seen as problematic when you aren't one. Keep in mind they do absolutely want to minimize the amount they pay you and if they could make you work for free they would. Negotiating is unfortunately still one of the very best skills you can have to maximize your salary. How you come into the first interview will set the tone for your entire employment there and no raises later will make up for the differences.",

    "Also apparently studies found that gender also influences how people are perceived while negotiating. \n\nA man negotiating is seen as a sign of self-confidence and is therefore positive, etc. A woman on the other hand is seen as more demanding and aggressive.",
    "OP, the smartest way to do it would be to apply to the new position, requesting $85~89K, stating your experience there of 4 years as a reason for the expected salary being in the higher end of their posted range.\n\nApproach the hiring manager for the new role and express your strong interest.\n\nApproach your current manager and tell them that you are interested in the new role. Allow them to promise a salary match to keep you.\n\nIf neither strategies pan out - start looking for a new position outside.\n\nI fecking hate corporate warfare, but you gotta weaponize the system against itself. If you just approach HR and your boss with the ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù - they will just shrug it off and promise to look into it and then just sweep it under the carpet. Your submitting an application forces them legally to deal with the salary imbalance by either offering you a new job or matching your salary to keep you. Ultimately they can still tell you to pound sand, but it‚Äôs a lot harder to do.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm a dude and I‚Äôve been in your exact situation. Unfortunately, the longer term employees are almost always paid less than newcomers. Additionally, some people are just better at brown nosing, ahem, building relationships with their management, unlike some of us who believe managers should recognize and reward the talent, experience and added value; not level of personal relationship. Most of the times I‚Äôve raised my income only by jumping ships. Having said that - my spouse also had a heck of a shitty time being a woman in a male-dominated industry and what comes to her male colleagues by default had to have been clawed out for her, fighting tooth and nail.

It‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I even want anything to do with payroll/accounting/bookkeeping anymore, I‚Äôm probably pivoting careers because it‚Äôs so soul crushing to see it in action intimately day to day. Seeing the salary discrepancies is ROUGH and I can tell you first hand that it comes down to how pushy people are, how hard they advocate for themselves, and that the negotiation model for salary is inherently biased towards exactly who you think it is. \n\nAfter working with payroll for 10 years, I am a staunch advocate against companies saying ‚Äúyou just need to negotiate‚Äù because SO many people come from backgrounds where they‚Äôve been told they will straight up get fired if they ask for more, like how OP is crashing out right now about getting fired for this very real inequity between her and her male coworker. And that‚Äôs not some imagined thing, women and poc absolutely will get fired or at least ignored in some cases when they ask for more money. In my experience, many of the people who have a lot of job creep absolutely end up being the least paid and it‚Äôs because they are being taken advantage of, even if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood‚Äù company. So for anyone reading this that feels like they are underpaid for how much they have taken on, or underpaid for the market rate of their role, or feel like they are being gaslit by their company about pay - trust your gut because I would say 99% chance that you are indeed and that you would be sick to see all of the payroll information for the company. And good companies do this too, my last company did seem like they cared about staff but they still took advantage of me. They will do it if you let them, don‚Äôt ever take on more long term responsibilities without negotiating more pay.",

Like my professionalism is tied to not ever saying anything about the salary information I‚Äôm seeing, even to other underpaid people who have access to it as well, but it‚Äôs so difficult when you have to see it in your face like that and you know that there‚Äôs zero context that makes it more understandable‚Ä¶ makes me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me for not being able to not be upset by it. \n\nIt was especially hard for me once I got to a higher level where I was sitting in on a lot of salary and hiring discussions and had to see that certain people (men mostly) are just given the salary they ask for without any question or pushback and are super confident in doing so, whereas women will be gaslit and pushed back against when they try to negotiate, which is enough for most people to back down if you have been told your whole life that you‚Äôll be fired for even asking about pay.

Operate with your own best interests in mind. \n\nThat means changing companies every now and then in order to maintain at the market rate, do not allow a company that has done something bad to you to make up for it by just paying you more money (if they are willing to truly acknowledge the bad thing they did, and take real action to not just resolve it but prevent it from happening again in the future, that's a different story).\n\nHave your own best interest in mind, don't do things that will put a target on your back. \n\nBut what do I know, I've only climbed the corporate ladder for the last 30 years making hiring decisions for at least the last 15. I've only seen this game play out dozens if not hundreds of times. \n\nLook out for yourself, don't look out for the company. If you have a better offer (and that does not mean just a higher salary, there is more to an offer than just the money, it also includes what kind of work, working conditions, other benefits, it's an entire package), then you should take the better offer. \n\nOne of the few times that you shouldn't take the better offer is if you just changed companies, you don't want your resume to make it look like you hop companies every 2 years because then new companies won't want to hire you because they know that they're going to spend the first 6 months training you and only get 1.5 years of work. But after 4 years? And with cause? Absolutely, take the better offer. \n\nWhen interviewing for those other positions, you also want to be careful how you describe the reason why you left the prior company. You don't want to come across as someone who's just ragging on the previous company, because however you speak about that previous company during the interview is how the new company is going to view how you're going to speak about them. \n\nIt's all a game, and the sooner you learn the rules of this game, the better.",

Definitely stop planning things like department retreats.\n\nThe documentation you can use as an argument to show you're delivering over and above usual expectations for the role.\n\nBe strategic about what extra work you take on and why.

Companies regularly let employee raises fall below market rate increases. So when you were hired at 58k that may have been the market rate or you may have accepted an offer on the lower end of the scale.\n\n\nAs the years have rolled on the market rate has increased significantly while you've been given tiny raises.\n\n\nPerhaps there's an element of sexism, but this story gets posted all the time with different genders.\n\n\nYou have a couple options. Number 1 top of the list is to start applying for jobs elsewhere. Nothing else is as likely to get you a higher salary.\n\n\nSecond, and it sounds like you've done this in the past, is to ask your company for a market rate adjustment. You now apparently even have an internal posting to prove the market rate is significantly higher than your salary.\n\n\nThird you apply for this newly posted position in your company.\n\n\nAt the very bottom of my list would be consulting a lawyer about a discrimination type case. I just don't think that route is going to get you anywhere. Unless there is a repeated and verifibly pattern of under paying women it's not going anywhere. One employee being paid less than new hires, isn't a case, and is in fact incredibly common.",

The whole \"women don't negotiate well\" is, in my experience, bullshit. In a place with a shit manager and shit HR if you used the high handed techniques they suggest, you will get fired or managed out. Its what people say to excuse bad management. Don't internalize that blame.\n\nSo what do you do? Its tough, but here's what I've done before. First, for now, leave your colleague out of it. You have a publicly placed ad. Put on your most enthusiastic self, schedule time with your manager, and say I am so excited to learn the budget constraints you mentioned have been resolved. I'm seeing here that the salary band for positions similar to my own is X to Y now, so I'd like to discuss salary adjustments. \n\nUse the words \"salary band\" and \"similar position\". If they say no, then - with curiosity - ask how salary bands are set at the company. If they don't have company wide comp structure then with dismay and surprise, note how dangerous that is for the company. \"Why that leaves them wide open to complaints!\" Be concerned and suggest he consult with HR about. \n\nIf they say yes, then ask what distinguishes this position from your position in the comp structure and how you can increase your skills to get there.\n\nMeanwhile look for a new job. Seriously. You have a shit manager and shit HR. Nothing will fix the ultimate problem and that problem isn‚Äôt you.",

And so bosses and companies aren‚Äôt consciously saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a woman who will pay her less,‚Äù but they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwill give a low offer and see what she asks for.‚Äù\n\nBut in a way, you‚Äôre being a woman gives you some leverage in this conversation. Don‚Äôt be accusatory, frame it as you looking out for the company. Say to HR, ‚ÄúI have realized that I make less as an experience employee then you were willing to pay someone totally new to the company. I also know that I make significantly less than Jake and all the other people in my position, all of whom are men. The company is now very vulnerable to accusations of pay discrimination on the grounds of sex. I would like to see you rectify that situation and then the process pay me what I‚Äôm worth. Arguments about lack of revenue, etc., don‚Äôt hold water anymore, and the proof is in that job listing. It‚Äôs also in the fact that Jake was hired after I asked for salary correction.\n\nBefore you go, though, go to all of your other peeps who in the same position and ask them to share their salary history with you. What do they start, what were they offered, when did they get raises of how much.\n\nYou might also wait for the confrontation until after you‚Äôve spoken with an employment lawyer. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd bring up ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to a lawyer‚Äú in that very first conversation, but it would be good to have your legal options known and that pathway in place should you need it?\n\nI want to remind you that it is illegal to retaliate against you for sharing salaries when you do so for the purpose of negotiating, which this absolutely is. Of course, people and companies do illegal things, and they have to get corrected after the fact, but there is a labor department in your state, for now there is a federal labor department, although it is becoming more and more toothless\n\nThat is also why having that conversation with the lawyer ahead of time will be good, because the moment it starts to look like the company is going to retaliate against you for having this conversation or talking with people about their salaries, their lawyer can step in and apply some pressure to get them to do the right thing",

New hires get current rates while old hires are relying on raises that barely keep up with inflation and maybe a slightly bigger bump from promotions. It never lines up with what a new company will pay or even what your current company would pay for years of experience and current market for new hires. You can talk to HR and payroll and your boss until you‚Äôre blue in the face and they‚Äôll justify it any way they can as to why they can‚Äôt increase you by such a large amount. The funny (depressing) thing is if you walked in and quit tomorrow, the job posting to replace you will probably show the salary range you‚Äôre asking them for.\n\n\nI would stop focusing so much on how or why it happened and put your energy towards your next steps. If market rate is currently closer to Jake‚Äôs salary for new employees that means someone at Senior level like yourself with about 5yrs of experience should be making even more. Start applying externally and get an offer letter with the salary you actually want. If you actually like your job and company, take that salary number to your current company and ask them if they‚Äôre willing to match it or you‚Äôre gone.\n\nGoing forward for the rest of your career, you need to realize that this is the way the game is played now. Prevailing advice seems to be 2yrs but I think that‚Äôs a little ridiculous as it takes most people at least a year to become fully useful at any given job unless you‚Äôre entering a role you have tons of experience in and the company operates like your previous one. 4 to 5 yrs is the sweet spot imo for starting to look externally and see how much you‚Äôre worth.",

They are not pushed out of the organization, like women. Google it. You'll see multiple studies confirming that \"negotiating\" is just their excuse to pay men more when they actually punish women for these behaviours. \n\nThe other issue is that when you go to a new company, they are likely to use the last amount you were paid as a way to justify paying you less again. I'd apply to a different company, increase the salary that I was making beforehand to be within that internal range, and stop doing extra things like organizing events. Women don't benefit in any way from these sorts of tasks. It's literally the equivalent of being asked to take notes or make coffee.

Neither is of relevance because they have their budget and either their offer matches your expectations (after some negotiation) or it doesn't. Problem is when you really need the job and honestly who doesn't, then you are less likely to be so firm about it.\n\nThe interviewers can tell instantly so you can't fake it and if you need work you might want to accept the first offer and at the same time keep looking and doing interviews. I know people who do that and end up quitting in their first weeks immediately because knowing they got a mediocre job that pays rent allowed them to be so much more confident.\n\nWhen they ask you anything about money you immediately tell them verbatim that you expect them to make an offer (of course remain respectful). Write down what you might say when you get pushback so you don't stumble when they inevitably ask why you don't want to answer. One of the answers might be \"because it's of no relevance, you got your budget so let's go from there.\" No need to ELI5 your answers either because these interviewers know exactly what's going on. If they keep playing dumb that's insulting and if they refuse to make an offer you can consider it a lost cause and ask to talk to someone in a supervisor role as you would like to give feedback immediately about how your interviewer(s) seem to be derailing the interview for no reason (again in a respecfull manner). (Another trick is to burn the first interviews on purpose and go in knowing it's practice and you were always going to waste their time.)\n\nYou are absolutely right that even though they expect this from a man you will often be seen as problematic when you aren't one. Keep in mind they do absolutely want to minimize the amount they pay you and if they could make you work for free they would. Negotiating is unfortunately still one of the very best skills you can have to maximize your salary. How you come into the first interview will set the tone for your entire employment there and no raises later will make up for the differences.",

Allow them to promise a salary match to keep you.\n\nIf neither strategies pan out - start looking for a new position outside.\n\nI fecking hate corporate warfare, but you gotta weaponize the system against itself. If you just approach HR and your boss with the ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù - they will just shrug it off and promise to look into it and then just sweep it under the carpet. Your submitting an application forces them legally to deal with the salary imbalance by either offering you a new job or matching your salary to keep you. Ultimately they can still tell you to pound sand, but it‚Äôs a lot harder to do.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm a dude and I‚Äôve been in your exact situation. Unfortunately, the longer term employees are almost always paid less than newcomers. Additionally, some people are just better at brown nosing, ahem, building relationships with their management, unlike some of us who believe managers should recognize and reward the talent, experience and added value; not level of personal relationship. Most of the times I‚Äôve raised my income only by jumping ships. Having said that - my spouse also had a heck of a shitty time being a woman in a male-dominated industry and what comes to her male colleagues by default had to have been clawed out for her, fighting tooth and nail.

Mention any positive feedback you got on the retreat or the training documentation. Make it clear you obviously trained Jake well, because they pay him $18,000 more than you. Note that you've seen they are advertising the position for a range STARTING at $8000 more than you currently make. \n\nAsk for an increase to $84,000. If they lowball you, tell them they found the budget to pay other people properly and you're wondering why they think that shouldn't happen with you, given your excellent work and ‚Äòabove and beyond‚Äô attitude. And if you don't come out of there with a significant increase in your salary, say, ‚Äúit's really disappointing that you don't see the value that I bring to the organisation, but thank you for clarifying your position. I'll take this all into consideration.‚Äù After that, don't do any extra on top of your job description. Instead spend the extra time looking for another job that pays more. If they complain about you not doing extra, say very calmly that it's been made clear to you that extra effort is not appreciated or rewarded at this company and just leave it at that.\n\nBut OP, you cannot say any of this in an overly emotional way, with your voice trembling or giving any hint of insecurity as to whether they will see you as with the extra money. If everything you've described is true, you do deserve this. Practice out loud at home if you need to until you can simply point these things out calmly and confidently.
