"Was a bit surprised I had to make it this far to get to a comment mentioning the fact OP hasn’t had children and that we know that makes IUD insertion more painful. What’s especially insane to me is that I’m not that much older than OP, only around a decade, and I remember when IUDs were literally not even considered an option in women, especially younger ones, who had never had a pregnancy. We didn’t even think it was safe to do not all that long ago and also let this speak to how lacking the research is on female bodies and anatomy! 

For gosh sake, as a case in point, it wasn’t until sometime in the 1990s- not a typo, literally the NINETEEN NINETIES so within my own dang lifetime and that of many reading this- that we had even properly recognized and mapped out clitoral anatomy and that the clitoris isn’t just the little nub with a hood that’s visible above the labia minora, but actually a far larger and more complex structure. Gosh, we still have people doing studies today on IUD insertion and pain and it’s a fact that different countries tend to carry different views around pain management for the procedure. And oh hey, no surprise, the US tends to do less whereas the numbing and things OP only learned about too late is the unquestioned standard of practice in many places- even for women who have had pregnancy or prior uncomplicated IUD insertions- to numb the cervix and manage the patients pain. 

It literally wasn’t that long ago that we not only didn’t even generally give IUDs to folks who had never had a pregnancy (there also were only like two options for IUD on the market back then and I believe there were serious issues with one that was pulled from the market. So we are also in general, discussing fairly new, as far as medical management and pregnancy prevention goes products. But given just how popular IUDs have become it’s also not a surprise to any gynecologist that some women find them incredibly painful!) but they actually used to find the most ideal and easiest time to place them was shortly after a woman gave birth. I knew folks who 15 or so years ago  (was heavily encouraged- and we can judge this however one wishes. It’s not a great look either…in low income, aka Medicaid patients, who had pregnancies at younger ages or no doubt too, when unmarried…). So at a point when the cervix was already more open than typical.

I feel pissed off for OPs sake and the more I typed and thought this one out, the more angry I got. I was recalling that not only am I not that much older but I also have a lifelong history of extremely painful and problematic periods but also PCOS so severe that even though ultrasound techs aren’t supposed to tell patients what they see until a doctor reads the results and all- techs can’t help but comment on how severe and obvious my PCOS is because my ovaries are literally 4x normal size with all the cysts. 


Which is where I recalled that it was a female ER doc who blew me off and sent me home from the ER without so much as an ultrasound (she basically brushed it off as unnecessary because I’d been in the ER several times before for ruptured ovarian cysts which itself is very painful and which I recall upsetting my gyn at the time when I was refusing to be seen even if I knew o ruptured a cyst because the view was even then, you need to be promptly examined to make sure it was merely an uncomplicated cyst and nothing more serious. Literally I would even call this gyn while in this pain and be told if I was in that much pain and it wasn’t subsiding I needed an ER not a gyn appt!) with me literally unable to walk going “No, I know I rupture cysts a lot and this pain isn’t *that* I think something is really, seriously wrong.” I had ovarian torsion. My ovary was twisted around on itself twice and I’m only lucky that it likely was repeatedly twisting and untwisting (if it had remained twisted as severely as it was finally found to be, the tissue could’ve begun to die from lack of blood flow and I could’ve developed a serious infection and complications that would’ve killed me!).

Instead I just effing tolerated- was lucky the medical view on pain management hasn’t yet become what it is (another topic that gets me enraged and I think is incredibly valid in this discussion too. Since even when opiates were more freely used or used at all, women and especially young women or People of Color and other minorities, were well known for having their pain- from any source- under treated and dismissed. I strongly suspect we’ve only moved backwards yet again in this respect!) and was on substantial amounts of opiate pain meds for a myriad of very serious and life limiting medical conditions. 

Even then I was taking way more pain meds and just lived for several WEEKS in disabling pain with torsion. Which could’ve literally killed me…. So fuck bad doctors. Especially those who have ovaries themselves and who tell young menstruating women they’re just being “dramatic”. Grrrr. I literally used to sometimes be grateful to have a male doc in the ER because while they would likely downplay my pain, as soon as a ruptured cyst was diagnosed, it was actually the men who often treated me best and would be getting me pain meds asap apologizing and remarking that oh hey, ruptured cysts are serious. Well torsion was a level far beyond that.

"OP, you very well could have a low pain tolerance but that does not excuse your doctor’s dismissiveness of your pain.

Everyone handles things like this differently. 

I had to have a LEEP procedure in the time between my 1st and 2nd IUD. Because of this I have some scar tissue on my cervix and it would not open for my second IUD insertion. My doctor had to use a device to dilate my cervix enough to open it and place the IUD. 

I had never felt pain like that until I had my child a couple months ago. I wasn’t expecting it to hurt like that so I went in raw with no pain management and I do not recommend that. I have a high pain tolerance and I basically tried to talk my way through it (I let out a loud “holy fucking shit” after the 5th and final attempt to place my IUD), but I would not wish that pain on anyone.

Since it is the worst pain they have ever felt their pain is a 10. Another person cut their finger, doesn't require stitches. It is a mild injury. That cut is the worst pain they have ever felt before so they say their pain is a 10 too.

So long as you don't continue to have pain for days then you should keep it in for now. Feel your emotions so you can process them, but don't make any decisions right now about whether to keep it. 

Once you've hopefully processed your emotions (I say hopefully, because that stuff is hard to do) then you can think a bit clearer on whether to keep it or not. So long as it isn't causing you any discomfort, there isn't any benefit to removing it now. Instead what you can focus on is finding a new gynecologist who respects you and discusses things with you properly. 

A lesson I think we all learn from these experiences, is that even if a letter tells you to just take paracetamol or ibuprofen, things inside your vagina/cervix hurt.
