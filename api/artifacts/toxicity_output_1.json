    "Interesting read.\n\nThey did suggest that while the grandmother hypothesis doesn‚Äôt apply, the avoiding conflict over resources hypothesis might apply.",
    "That's possible. But it's equally likely that there's no selective advantage at all to having people survive long enough to be grandmothers. It may simply be a side effect of our socialisation and technological advancement.\n\nEvolutionary biologists are well aware that there's a tendency among non-specialists to believe that any and every observable feature is a result of evolutionary pressure. In reality, many traits exist simply due to random mutations or practices that are evolutionarily neutral, or which are artifacts of a different factor.\n\nSo it's entirely possible (I would say, even likely) that we have menopause simply as an evolutionarily-advantageous energy-saving factor in early life. The developing female fetus spends the energy required producing enough eggs to last her through a normal lifespan, and no more. The fact that (under the normal conditions that shaped our evolution) a few individuals lived longer than that is largely irrelevant as far as evolutionary selection goes. If you haven't successfully reproduced and raised kids by the time you're 50-ish, the chance that you'll do so successfully thereafter is pretty slim, even if you remain fertile, so it's hard to see a a selective advantage there.\n\nWe see this in immunology, too. People ask why our immune system starts to fail decades before we actually die. And it's true, our immune systems peak in late childhood through adolescence as organs such as the thymus start to involute and atrophy. Over time, this leads to a gradual immune imbalance that we refer to as immunosenescence, which starts to become clinically relevant around the age of 50. From there on, we rapidly become more susceptible to infection and cancer and less able to repair trauma. From the point of view of the older individual, this is most definitely not a useful evolutionary advantage. But producing all these immune cells (most of which rapidly die) is a very energy intensive process. There's an obvious advantage to shutting it down when you no longer need it. Earlier in our evolutionary history, when most people were dead by 50, and when their chance of reproductive success was extremely low by that point, there was no counterbalancing advantage.\n\nSo, like menopause, it's quite possible that the outcomes we see in older life are simply a result of the fact that for most of our evolutionary history that \"older life\" barely existed.",
    "Women don‚Äôt produce enough eggs to last a typical lifespan and never have. The estimated human lifespan, after accounting for childhood mortality rates, has always reached into the sixties when women would be incapable of reproducing (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2868286/).",
    "This is true and it makes sense. That being said most people simply didn‚Äôt live as long for most of human history as well. \n\nAdditionally there is still a lot of fear mongering around the subject and even the biological science isn‚Äôt all that well understood compared to many others. Reality is patriarchy and consumerism to a degree are the big benefactors of that fear mongering so shocker it‚Äôs still around. That being said we have come a long way at extending it and the it is wildly different from woman to woman. I know many woman who had their kids around 40 (even in olden times they had a lot more kids, it‚Äôs not like they had 2-3 in their 20s and stopped, life was brutish and short for most of human history with many not making it out of childhood).",
    "On the flip side, another interpretation of that theory is just that we're good at taking care of members of our society who can't take care of themselves. So, us and similarly social animals simply live to older ages than we would otherwise be able to because of social support.¬†",

    "Really the two issues go together.\n\n1) childbirth is extremely risky and over 40, before modern medicine, would have a very high mortality rate. The result is that nature wouldn‚Äôt select for mothers who could have children later in life because so few would produce enough additional offspring to affect the population.\n\nAnd\n\n2) Having older women as part of the group was generally beneficial and helped families thrive. So natural selection favored families where women more often survived past 40. This would have favored families with the genetic traits of menopause because of the very high mortality rate for women giving birth after 40 without modern medicine.\n\nThis is also why the trait is somewhat unique. You need both the high risk of death of the mother in childbirth and a social structure that allows younger generations to do better because of the existence of older generations of non-childbearing adults for this dynamic to exist.",
    "You neatly summarise two important mechanisms that can explain menopause. To add to this, human children demand an enormous amount of care for a long time. Losing their parents or caretakers may severely screw up a child, severely reducing their chances at becoming functional adults. Menopause starts around 50, which effectively means the woman may well be past 65 (which probably was very old in prehistoric times) before her offspring is capable of taking care of themselves. In an evolutionary perspective, when the likelihood of birth complications increases dramatically and you may well die before they reach adulthood, at this point ensuring that your current children and grandchildren reaches adulthood as healthy, functional adults becomes more beneficial to spreading your genes than giving birth to more children.",
    "The older you are the higher the chances of complications, but you can still help rear children including your grandchildren even if you aren't fertile",

Some whale species and some chimpanzees are also animals that live beyond menopause.\n\nThere's a few theories as to why we live beyond menopause.  One is the grandmother theory, where elder females sticking around will encourage more reproduction in the younger females by teaching them how to do it right. So even if they've lost fertility, it's a net positive for the breeding population.",
    "iirc this was shown in elephants where the grandma is needed when the mother is lacking¬†",

Here's the [spotify link](https://spotify.link/Vq7i6hQ5LXb) if you're still curious after the heaps of comments here\n\nTo sum it up, pods of whales that had post-menopausal \"grandmother\" whales in them had better survival odds. They would often catch food for the younger whales and just be a good all around support. There were some other animal kingdom examples too. A good listen.",
    "this is kind of an unsolved mystery in science, bc I think humans are one of just a few animals to stop reproducing long before we die.\n\nBut I like the explanation that older women are most useful as educators and community organizers. Having Grandma around to explain the finer points of foraging or toolmaking, keep peace in the group, and remember which way the antelope ran 40 years ago was a bigger benefit to people who shared her genes than having her keep cranking out babies until her last breath.\n\nGrandma would also serve as a backup caregiver if something happened to Mom.\n\n(Grandmas are still serving in all of those capacities today!)\n\nHumans are just complicated social creatures with a *lot* of use to a group beyond just reproduction.\n\nAnd since we put such an outrageously high level of investment in our offspring, it doesn't really make sense for a woman to keep having babies until the end of her life: she'd leave behind a lot of very dependent offspring to perish, with a lot of energy and resources already poured into them! What a waste!\n\nCutting it off by 50 and having her live on another few decades is, if nothing else, a pretty solid way to help ensure even the youngest kids are pretty self sufficient by the time Mom passes.",
    "My uneducated guess is that the cellular machinery needed for reproduction is far less robust than cells from other areas of the body, like the nervous or digestive system, for instance. I mean, didn't we learn in health class or something that when a woman is born, she already has all the eggs she'll ever have? If so 50, 70, 90 years is a long time for the DNA in those eggs to remain undamaged, at least to the extent they could produce a viable pregnancy.",

I‚Äôm sure most of our organs are going, ‚ÄúDamn, I didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd have to work *this* long.‚Äù\n\n- again, historically, for thousands of years, we have needed a group of the population to help raise, mentor and protect the youngest, so the child-bearing women could continue to birth more babies (lots of babies used to die for a wide variety of reasons), then work in the home by cooking, cleaning or in the fields with other younger, stronger parts of the population. So, in essence, we‚Äôve always needed Grandmas.",

    "There is actually a running theory that, from an evolutionary standpoint, older women go through menopause so they can assist younger women going through childbirth. Human childbirth is incredibly dangerous as birth goes, before modern medicine a lot of women died during it. So when an older women has gone through menopause without the possibility of death by childbirth, they can use their knowledge and experience to assist younger women through it. \nIt's an interesting biological theory. \n\nAnother reason could be that as the body ages, it's not really able to cope as well a pregnancy, pregnancy take A LOT out of the body both physically and mentally. No one wants to be going through all that at 60+ \n\nAnother another reason could be that Human children take a long time to biological mature enough to be independent when compared to other animals. Having children when say, over 60, would increase the chance of the parent dying and leaving a child without care givers. We kind of forget that we too are animals and at one stage in our evolution, we were living in caves afraid of wolves. From an evolutionary standpoint, it does make sense even if humans are currently in a position where that isn't an issue, our bodies remember.",

When the reality is really far from it. Other moms helped with breastfeeding: whether to teach or actually get the baby to latch to their breast. When that wasn‚Äôt available infants were given milk from other animals or sometimes foods pre-6m. There‚Äôs a reason why infant mortality was so high for millennial and it wasn‚Äôt just lack of vaccines and medical care. \n\nSo, if you‚Äôre a mom in the 21st century and people are saying women have done this for thousands of years, in regards to breastfeeding, pregnancy, or childbirth. It‚Äôs technically true, but it didn‚Äôt come without problems. Otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be so many little baby graves or women that died young from complications from childbirth birth. A better understanding is that for woman in the western world in the 21st century, motherhood is incredibly isolating.",

All sounds lovely but the grandmother skips the line in the shop with the kid, hits the kid, throws trash around, lets the kid run wild, holds the kid up half naked to pee out onto a street as hundreds of motorbikes drive by, etc. etc. \n\n\nThey raise them like they are still on the side of a mountain and it's so obvious going downstairs in my building which kids have the grandmother taking care of them compared to the parents. These children are taught by standards two generations back when everything was completely different.\n\n\n\nIt stunts societal development when the young have kids that elders raise. I teach in Vietnam and the students who live with grandparents always complain about it. Old-fashioned, instilling misogynistic views and all that, especially in the girls.\n\n\nI posted about this ten months ago and believe it even more strongly now. \n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hawcb0/is_social_change_slower_in_countries_where/",

It may simply be a side effect of our socialisation and technological advancement.\n\nEvolutionary biologists are well aware that there's a tendency among non-specialists to believe that any and every observable feature is a result of evolutionary pressure. In reality, many traits exist simply due to random mutations or practices that are evolutionarily neutral, or which are artifacts of a different factor.\n\nSo it's entirely possible (I would say, even likely) that we have menopause simply as an evolutionarily-advantageous energy-saving factor in early life. The developing female fetus spends the energy required producing enough eggs to last her through a normal lifespan, and no more. The fact that (under the normal conditions that shaped our evolution) a few individuals lived longer than that is largely irrelevant as far as evolutionary selection goes. If you haven't successfully reproduced and raised kids by the time you're 50-ish, the chance that you'll do so successfully thereafter is pretty slim, even if you remain fertile, so it's hard to see a a selective advantage there.\n\nWe see this in immunology, too. People ask why our immune system starts to fail decades before we actually die. And it's true, our immune systems peak in late childhood through adolescence as organs such as the thymus start to involute and atrophy. Over time, this leads to a gradual immune imbalance that we refer to as immunosenescence, which starts to become clinically relevant around the age of 50. From there on, we rapidly become more susceptible to infection and cancer and less able to repair trauma. From the point of view of the older individual, this is most definitely not a useful evolutionary advantage. But producing all these immune cells (most of which rapidly die) is a very energy intensive process. There's an obvious advantage to shutting it down when you no longer need it. Earlier in our evolutionary history, when most people were dead by 50, and when their chance of reproductive success was extremely low by that point, there was no counterbalancing advantage.\n\nSo, like menopause, it's quite possible that the outcomes we see in older life are simply a result of the fact that for most of our evolutionary history that \"older life\" barely existed.",

In an evolutionary perspective, when the likelihood of birth complications increases dramatically and you may well die before they reach adulthood, at this point ensuring that your current children and grandchildren reaches adulthood as healthy, functional adults becomes more beneficial to spreading your genes than giving birth to more children.",

Human childbirth is incredibly dangerous as birth goes, before modern medicine a lot of women died during it. So when an older women has gone through menopause without the possibility of death by childbirth, they can use their knowledge and experience to assist younger women through it. \nIt's an interesting biological theory. \n\nAnother reason could be that as the body ages, it's not really able to cope as well a pregnancy, pregnancy take A LOT out of the body both physically and mentally. No one wants to be going through all that at 60+ \n\nAnother another reason could be that Human children take a long time to biological mature enough to be independent when compared to other animals. Having children when say, over 60, would increase the chance of the parent dying and leaving a child without care givers. We kind of forget that we too are animals and at one stage in our evolution, we were living in caves afraid of wolves. From an evolutionary standpoint, it does make sense even if humans are currently in a position where that isn't an issue, our bodies remember.",
