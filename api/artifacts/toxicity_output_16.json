Education is pushing boys out, dating is more competitive than ever (especially with online dating skewing things), and many grow up without strong male role models.\n\nWhen guys feel like they’re struggling and no one cares, they turn to people like Tate, not because they agree with everything, but because at least he acknowledges their struggles and gives them a path forward—even if it’s a flawed one. Society tells men to \"do better,\" but doesn’t show them how, so they find their own answers, for better or worse.",

      "text": "There’s an outdated sentiment that men are inherently privileged relative to women that affects academia and then media and culture which are downstream from it. When men point out that this is no longer a valid sentiment, they are shouted down and called names at worst, and just out of touch at best.\n\nThe mainstream media gets uneasy when it comes to discussing male suffering. It has no problem supporting women and people of color when they are struggling, and that is a beautiful thing, but what happens when it is men who are struggling?\n\nIn many cities of the US women under the age of 30 earn more than their male counterparts.\n\nAs of 2022, single women own 58% of homes by unmarried Americans, compared to 42% for single men.\n\nAlso as of fall 2022, 57.9% of postsecondary students were women. In 1970, this ratio was nearly identical in the opposite direction, and there was sufficient concern over the disparity that the US passed Title IX in 1972 to rectify it.\n\nIn the 2023–2024 academic year, 54.6% of medical students in the United States were women. In 2023, women made up 55.8% of the entering class of law students, up from 55.2% in 2022. Women have outnumbered men in law school classrooms for the past eight years in a row.\n\nMen account for somewhere between 70% and 84% of all homeless people. Men are four times as likely to commit suicide. These deaths of despair mostly affect working class men. \n\nIf any of the stats above had women as disadvantaged, there would be outrage and massive efforts to balance things. But since men are the ones affected, we turn a blind eye and tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Again, when men point out this disparity they are gaslit and meet with derision, rather than compassion.",

I don’t want to go into detail to what extent are the arguments for actively helping women on many fronts valid or invalid, that’s a debate for hours. But regardless of how relevant these actions are, the current direct or indirect actions make the life of many men harder. Economically as well as sexually/relationship-wise. I think many men would welcome, if women and society would at least acknowledge the reality. When you try to say, that hiring female programmers over more qualified men for the sake of “diversity” or women having super easy access to hook-up with attractive men is not harming most of the other gender, you’re trying to prove that the Earth is flat.",

The problem is both conservatives and progressives really hate male homosexuality, and if not severely devalue it. For some reason the idea that a man can just date other men scares a lot of people. When my fam found out I’m gay, both my parents were begging me, quite hysterically I’d say, to try fucking at least one female. Kind of sad and creepy actually",

The man vs. bear thing, dismissing “not all men” as a rational counterpoint to sexist statements, and a general antipathy towards men are examples. \n\nFor instance, your reddit handle body shames men. If it was **u/NoFatWomen4Me** I’d consider that a sexist username designed to reduce women to their sexual desirability, as though women’s value to society lies in their potential to please male partners, and as a reminder to women who don’t meet that standard that they are “less than.” \n\nPower discrepancies between men and women in a patriarchal society are relevant. But when people ignore actual (dis)advantages individuals face, then it’s just hate based on identity, which undercuts the actual foundation of progressivism, which is humanism. \n\nFeminism isn’t a monolith, but most people aren’t going to feminist book clubs or engaging with the nuance. They’re just confronted with hypocrisy and seeing TRP defend against it (without clocking TRP’s many hypocritical and sexist stances).",

Even if he is, it's still treated like an exception and not a normality. \n\n\nWe have very harsh attitudes towards men struggling with women or dating in any way. Especially with their insecurities. We have spaces for women to openly hate men and spew mouth foaming vitriol without much consequence, but not nearly as much tolerance the other way around.

      "text": "I'd summarise it as \"we live in the 21st century, but pretend we're still in the 1960s\".\n\nThere are high expectations from men, but the social structure that allowed them to meet those expectations is long gone. For example, it is expected of men to provide for their household. It's unfortunately impossible now for the majority of people. On top of that, many women feel like they still work part-time jobs, so their men should bring \"real\" money. I know one woman with a salary of about $400k, who looks for a guy who earns more. Another expectation is being competent in approaching and courting women. It's hard for women to understand this, but a 17-18 years old guy doesn't naturally know how to do it.  \n\nThere is little support for men to meet these standards. Institutions support women with scholarships and employment opportunities. Families often leave their sons alone, because they think it's 1960s, and their son would be able to pay for his college with money from a summer job at a gas station.\n\nSo, your average guy faces some expectations and is not sure how to meet them. What adds another layer of problems is the standard narrative about masculinity. Growing up, the guy hears that traditional masculinity is bad,  that he shouldn't be aggressive, dominant, competitive, but better be compassionate, empathetic, and respectful. Then he sees that aggressive and dominant men get what they want, and no one generally gives a shit about your emotional availability. Also, there is this story about men who cause all the suffering. I get that men commit most violent crimes, but can we please have less of that rhetoric that \"men need to learn this, we need to teach men that\".\n\nFinally, it's difficult to talk about men's problems. Cannot get a date? Incel. Cannot get a good job? Loser. Many topics are just shrugged off. For example, the problem of false accusations of harassment. I often see an opinion that it's not even a problem to think of. Would you consider it a problem if your husband gets accused by a colleague with whom he competes for a promotion?",

And as the onus for initiating dates and relationship remains on boys and men, it is largely them that bares the brunt of all this.\n\nThe lack of *good* solutions from mainstream society (which says if you keep fit and healthy, dress respectably, make an effort with your appearance, and be a good person, \"the right person will come along\") sends boys and young men into the arms of grifters who instead say that you should do all of the above (except replacing the \"be a good person\" bit with being the darkest version of yourself) and radicalise them with pseudoscientific nonsense about \"female nature\" and \"evolutionary psychology\".",

It includes the man paying for most everything and doing the lions share of the work and effort for everything outside of the house.\n\n\nThe drawbacks of equality are essentially the opposite of all the above. Equality would mean women ought to do an equal share of the hard, heavy, and disgusting labour, that women are not entitled to privileged treatment and being treated like a princess, that women now should pay for half since women have careers and money as well, and that while men should shoulder more of the burdens inside the house, in turn she must also shoulder more of the burdens outside of the house as well. \n\n\nMost women would love to receive the former, and would hate to have to do most of the latter. Women largely have the privilege of choosing which parts of traditionalism and which parts of equality they want, while men are told to shut the fuck up, agree with her, and listen to what she wants. \n\n\nA huge part of equality that goes almost completely unaddressed and ignored is how women ought to emotionally support and encourage men as well, and recognizing how much emotional burden they place on men. As a society we're not even ready to have this conversation yet, because we haven't begun to realize how important men's feelings and emotions are in the first place. ",

As a society they are encouraged and empowered to do so regardless of the contradictions, hypocrisy, and difficulties it foists on men because society actively doesn't give a fuck about men. \n\n\nIndividual women may have more integrity and not choose buffet equality, but again it puts men at the mercy of women and whether or not that I dividual had integrity while the ones that don't are still empowered and entitled to demanding whatever they want from men while men are basically shamed for having any preferences. \n\n\nYou're not wrong, but this I feel is where you're not quite painting the full picture either. \n\n\nWe can't understand why young men feel disenfranchised if we can't paint an accurate picture of the situation young men are in. \n\n\nI largely agree with everything else you say, though the \"female nature\" stuff tends to be a direct refutal to the leftist/feminist dogma that men and women are identical blank slates at birth and that all gendered differences are due to socialization, and that biology does not in any way shape or form affect how people behave. The red pill pseudoscienfic nonsense is just as inaccurate as the feminist pseudo scientific nonsense, just pointing in the opposite direction. \n\n\nRed pill is a reaction to the situation that feminism has directly and actively set up. ",

My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nYou could only believe that’s the average woman’s experience in life if you think 9/10 women are average.  That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\n>while on contrast the vast majority of women will never simp for any man less than a 7.\n\nAgain, still off topic. Not one thing I said was to claim anything about men’s experiences in dating.  I am correcting the false belief that 5/10 women are treated like celebrities.  They’re not.   I’m not claiming they’re incels(what you seem to assume i said), but that men aren’t buying them free gifts and calling them gorgeous randomly on the street.  \n\nLike, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\n>I also think that our society has several unhealthy attitudes valuing women too much on their looks alone and valuing men too much on their achievements alone. It dehumanize both women and men in different ways, women as beauty objects and men as success objects. I think we should all value more kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners in each other. \n\nI agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. ",

For a relationship, they don’t actually date down the way men here insist men do.\n\nYou know that's actually fair, and is one thing that men should clarify, that while standards for ONS and starting a relationship are low, standards to have a long-term partner are high, as they should be. \n\n>And if you really think men are always dating “down”… don’t you find that kind of awful?   \n\nMen date \"up\" in terms of appearance because they want a woman who is good looking, where women tend to say they don't care as much about men's appearance.  Men and women evaluate one another on different standards, it's not an objective \"this woman is a 5 on everything and the man is a 6 on everything\".\n\nIt would help to be more clear and help each side understand the other better for sure though.\n\n>Getting just one is more than enough to be unhappy about it if it was creepy, meaning it scared her.\n\nAnd a woman getting one creepy approach every year for 10 years is still her getting approached 10x more by men than most men will ever be approached by women at all.\n\n>Most women are not flooded with attention— you’re only paying attention to the very hottest women.\n\nHow do we define flooded with attention though? Most women feel stared at, objectified, or creeped on by men at some point in their lives. Those are the things women tell men.\n\nMen basically never feel ever stared at, objectified, creeped on, approached by, appreciated, commented on, complimented on, or anything, ever, by the overwhelming majority of women in their lives. Most men feel completely and utterly invisible to women for the vast majority of their lives.\n\nIn contrast to men getting one compliment from random women a decade, women getting a random compliment a year or even a month, is being \"flooded\" with attention in comparison to what men are getting.\n\nMaybe you are considering \"flooded\" between the average woman and the most attractive women, but the average woman is still flooded with more attention than the vast majority of men will ever be. This I feel is what men mean when they say women are flooded with attention.\n\n> My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nThat's fair and I concede that. I was trying to say that when that argument is made, I believe that they mean to say \"in comparison to men\", even if they don't explicitly say it, because in comparison to men, it makes perfect sense.\n\n>That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\nTrue for free money out of nowhere, but if we define \"going on a date and having their meal paid for\", then yes, women get free money significantly more often than men. 1/3 of women polled on Tinder in Turkey admitted to going on dates with men they had no intention of dating, just for free meals. Women in N America have made posts about how they use dating to get free meals. \n\nNot all women, not all the time, but virtually every single time it does happen, it is practically always a woman, and practically always at the expense of men.\n\nWe can recognize not all women do this, and recognize that the overwhleming majority of people who do this and benefit from this, are women.\n\n>Like, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\nI'm not in the US so I genuinely do not know, do they actually shout that in public? How often does that happen?\n\n>I agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. \n\nAbsolutely. The commercialization of everything to make money off of everything, and devaluig of anything and everything you can't put a direct monetary value on, is causing enormous issues in society. We've forgotten that not everything that can be counted matters, and that not everything that matters can be counted.",

Boys' natural behaviours—higher energy, impulsivity, and physicality—lead to more suspensions, disciplinary actions, and misdiagnoses, which negatively affects their education and self-perception. Meanwhile, the way ADHD presents in girls is often quieter, so it flies under the radar. Both issues exist, but only one gets sympathy.\n\nAs for school structure, order is necessary, but education systems are increasingly designed in ways that favour how girls typically learn—more emphasis on sitting still, listening, following structured assignments, and less on hands-on, competitive, or active learning that engages boys. That’s why boys are falling behind academically while girls are excelling. Ignoring that just ensures the gap keeps growing.\n\nYour understanding of \"women and children first\" still implies that men are expendable, which is exactly the point being made. And yes, we *do* need an explanation for why women *automatically* need more protection than men. Is female life inherently more valuable? If so, doesn’t that contradict the entire idea of gender equality? Either we treat both sexes equally, or we admit we don’t actually believe in equality.",

Instead of working with boys’ energy levels and tendencies, the system punishes them for not learning like girls do.

Because men have never had significant dominance in the sphere of rights, but on average they had more responsibilities.\n\n\n\nSo I can understand why people are drawn to scammers like Andrew Tate, even though it is clear as day that RP is now full of toxicity and not useful. Men just want a sense of community because in many places feminism has led to men (especially white heterosexuals) being accused of all sins, even those they did not commit",

That's what true justice is.\n\n\nPer the male proving a woman got a shorter sentence for the same crime, given the courts are biased enough to give men a 60% longer sentence for being men, they're just as likely to reject any appeal by gm finding other sexist reasons anyways. \n\n\n\nAny sentencing where a certain group of people is punished harsher than another group for the same crime, is punishing people for being part of the group they belong to, and not for their individual actions. \n\n\nAnd the fact men get jail sentences 60% longer than women who commit the same crime shows very clearly that the US judicial system punishes men for being men, or gives women more lenient treatment simply because they are women. \n\n\nRather ironic that feminism pounces on the slightest differences that disadvantage women, but completely ignores anything that disadvantages men, no matter how egregious the injustice. \n\n\nJust goes to show that feminism treats equality like a one ways street exclusively to the benefit of women. ",

The dating market has changed because cultural shifts and technology have given women more options while maintaining traditional expectations for men.\n\nWomen are making choices that contribute to the imbalance—choosing higher standards, prioritising careers over relationships, and gravitating toward the top percentage of men. That’s their right, but it does create a system where a large portion of men are struggling to find partners.\n\nWhen the imbalance was skewed in men’s favour, society stepped in with systemic interventions to level the playing field for women. But now that the pendulum has swung the other way, suddenly, it’s just natural selection and men are told to deal with it. That’s the double standard.\n\nFixing it doesn’t mean suppressing women’s rights it means acknowledging that men’s struggles in dating and relationships aren’t just a personal “skill issue.” Society needs to stop shaming men for even bringing it up and recognise that the current landscape isn’t sustainable if half the population feels alienated.",

This isn’t some systemic oppression that men are facing by women, unless you’re going to argue women’s free will oppresses men.\n\nAnd the only reason why women are able to have higher standards, gravitate towards the top portion of men is because of men and their lower standards. It’s human nature to seek the best option you can get, so again, unless you’re arguing that women’s options or ability to choose certain options needs to be systematically suppressed, the only moral option is to change how men react to the new sexual marketplace.

The issue is that society recognizes systemic problems when they disadvantage women but calls it \"natural selection\" when men are struggling. That’s the hypocrisy.\n\nTelling men to \"stop simping\" and \"stop marrying slutty women\" is a non-solution. The idea that men could collectively shift the dating market through discipline is a fantasy just like telling women to stop chasing the top 10% of men wouldn’t work. The reality is, cultural and technological shifts (online dating, social media, career prioritisation) have changed the landscape in ways that overwhelmingly favor a small percentage of men and leave the rest struggling.\n\nIf men were simply failing on an individual level, we wouldn't see dating gaps increasing across the board. This is a systemic issue, not just personal failure. The solution isn't suppressing women’s rights, but it also isn’t gaslighting men into thinking their struggles are entirely self-inflicted. Society needs to acknowledge the imbalance instead of pretending men just need to \"cope better.\"",

How would you feel if you're entire ECE deprived you of anything resembling your manhood. And on top of this made you atone for sins?\n* Nearly all shop and trade funding in high schools has been gutted to fund women's studies.\n* Manufacturing (a 90%) male labor component was outsourced.\n* The 08 housing collapse was a mansession.\n* Nearly all office environments have been overtaken by HR, who's prioritizes female privilege above everything else.

To put it simply the system you advocate for has emasculated an entire generation of young men. \n\nIt’s why men have checked out on such a worrying scale, they aren’t dating, aren’t getting jobs, aren’t going outside and it’s because they’ve taught since day one that who they are as men is a problem. \n\nAnother part of it is young women (no offense intended ahead of time), they’ve been taught that they need to compete, belittle and destroy men their age instead of cooperating and creating healthy relationships with them. It’s like something out of an eldritch horror, all of the toxic aspects of femininity combined with some toxic elements of masculinity.",

      "text": "What is boyishness?\n\nAs for their desire for intimacy and others: those things may have been repressed due to problematic occurrences. There are obvious correct ways and to approach a woman and court her. Of course methods that deviate from this would cause alarm and be reprimanded. \n\nOne personal example I can think of is how I would be told that boys in my class pulled my hair bc they liked me (Is this the boyishness you speak of?). I was even told this by teachers! Now the young girls in my family are taken more seriously when such things happen to them and the boys are dealt with. When I heard my family members support her for speaking up and encouraging her to fight back I actually teared up. Because these were the same family members who told me to just ignore them or treat it as a compliment growing up. \n\nSo I don’t think our system is emasculating men. I think it is starting to not excuse disorderly behavior for the sake of “men being men”. I don’t see how that’s a problem. If they remove themselves from society because they can’t coexist without causing harm, then good riddance.",

When men point out that this is no longer a valid sentiment, they are shouted down and called names at worst, and just out of touch at best.\n\nThe mainstream media gets uneasy when it comes to discussing male suffering. It has no problem supporting women and people of color when they are struggling, and that is a beautiful thing, but what happens when it is men who are struggling?\n\nIn many cities of the US women under the age of 30 earn more than their male counterparts.\n\nAs of 2022, single women own 58% of homes by unmarried Americans, compared to 42% for single men.\n\nAlso as of fall 2022, 57.9% of postsecondary students were women. In 1970, this ratio was nearly identical in the opposite direction, and there was sufficient concern over the disparity that the US passed Title IX in 1972 to rectify it.\n\nIn the 2023–2024 academic year, 54.6% of medical students in the United States were women. In 2023, women made up 55.8% of the entering class of law students, up from 55.2% in 2022. Women have outnumbered men in law school classrooms for the past eight years in a row.\n\nMen account for somewhere between 70% and 84% of all homeless people. Men are four times as likely to commit suicide. These deaths of despair mostly affect working class men. \n\nIf any of the stats above had women as disadvantaged, there would be outrage and massive efforts to balance things. But since men are the ones affected, we turn a blind eye and tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Again, when men point out this disparity they are gaslit and meet with derision, rather than compassion.",

When you try to say, that hiring female programmers over more qualified men for the sake of “diversity” or women having super easy access to hook-up with attractive men is not harming most of the other gender, you’re trying to prove that the Earth is flat.",

If it was **u/NoFatWomen4Me** I’d consider that a sexist username designed to reduce women to their sexual desirability, as though women’s value to society lies in their potential to please male partners, and as a reminder to women who don’t meet that standard that they are “less than.” \n\nPower discrepancies between men and women in a patriarchal society are relevant. But when people ignore actual (dis)advantages individuals face, then it’s just hate based on identity, which undercuts the actual foundation of progressivism, which is humanism. \n\nFeminism isn’t a monolith, but most people aren’t going to feminist book clubs or engaging with the nuance. They’re just confronted with hypocrisy and seeing TRP defend against it (without clocking TRP’s many hypocritical and sexist stances).",

          "text": "I'd summarise it as \"we live in the 21st century, but pretend we're still in the 1960s\".\n\nThere are high expectations from men, but the social structure that allowed them to meet those expectations is long gone. For example, it is expected of men to provide for their household. It's unfortunately impossible now for the majority of people. On top of that, many women feel like they still work part-time jobs, so their men should bring \"real\" money. I know one woman with a salary of about $400k, who looks for a guy who earns more. Another expectation is being competent in approaching and courting women. It's hard for women to understand this, but a 17-18 years old guy doesn't naturally know how to do it.  \n\nThere is little support for men to meet these standards. Institutions support women with scholarships and employment opportunities. Families often leave their sons alone, because they think it's 1960s, and their son would be able to pay for his college with money from a summer job at a gas station.\n\nSo, your average guy faces some expectations and is not sure how to meet them. What adds another layer of problems is the standard narrative about masculinity. Growing up, the guy hears that traditional masculinity is bad,  that he shouldn't be aggressive, dominant, competitive, but better be compassionate, empathetic, and respectful. Then he sees that aggressive and dominant men get what they want, and no one generally gives a shit about your emotional availability. Also, there is this story about men who cause all the suffering. I get that men commit most violent crimes, but can we please have less of that rhetoric that \"men need to learn this, we need to teach men that\".\n\nFinally, it's difficult to talk about men's problems. Cannot get a date? Incel. Cannot get a good job? Loser. Many topics are just shrugged off. For example, the problem of false accusations of harassment. I often see an opinion that it's not even a problem to think of. Would you consider it a problem if your husband gets accused by a colleague with whom he competes for a promotion?",

It includes the man paying for most everything and doing the lions share of the work and effort for everything outside of the house.\n\n\nThe drawbacks of equality are essentially the opposite of all the above. Equality would mean women ought to do an equal share of the hard, heavy, and disgusting labour, that women are not entitled to privileged treatment and being treated like a princess, that women now should pay for half since women have careers and money as well, and that while men should shoulder more of the burdens inside the house, in turn she must also shoulder more of the burdens outside of the house as well. \n\n\nMost women would love to receive the former, and would hate to have to do most of the latter. Women largely have the privilege of choosing which parts of traditionalism and which parts of equality they want, while men are told to shut the fuck up, agree with her, and listen to what she wants. \n\n\nA huge part of equality that goes almost completely unaddressed and ignored is how women ought to emotionally support and encourage men as well, and recognizing how much emotional burden they place on men. As a society we're not even ready to have this conversation yet, because we haven't begun to realize how important men's feelings and emotions are in the first place. ",

As a society they are encouraged and empowered to do so regardless of the contradictions, hypocrisy, and difficulties it foists on men because society actively doesn't give a fuck about men. \n\n\nIndividual women may have more integrity and not choose buffet equality, but again it puts men at the mercy of women and whether or not that I dividual had integrity while the ones that don't are still empowered and entitled to demanding whatever they want from men while men are basically shamed for having any preferences. \n\n\nYou're not wrong, but this I feel is where you're not quite painting the full picture either. \n\n\nWe can't understand why young men feel disenfranchised if we can't paint an accurate picture of the situation young men are in. \n\n\nI largely agree with everything else you say, though the \"female nature\" stuff tends to be a direct refutal to the leftist/feminist dogma that men and women are identical blank slates at birth and that all gendered differences are due to socialization, and that biology does not in any way shape or form affect how people behave. The red pill pseudoscienfic nonsense is just as inaccurate as the feminist pseudo scientific nonsense, just pointing in the opposite direction. \n\n\nRed pill is a reaction to the situation that feminism has directly and actively set up. ",

My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nYou could only believe that’s the average woman’s experience in life if you think 9/10 women are average.  That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\n>while on contrast the vast majority of women will never simp for any man less than a 7.\n\nAgain, still off topic. Not one thing I said was to claim anything about men’s experiences in dating.  I am correcting the false belief that 5/10 women are treated like celebrities.  They’re not.   I’m not claiming they’re incels(what you seem to assume i said), but that men aren’t buying them free gifts and calling them gorgeous randomly on the street.  \n\nLike, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\n>I also think that our society has several unhealthy attitudes valuing women too much on their looks alone and valuing men too much on their achievements alone. It dehumanize both women and men in different ways, women as beauty objects and men as success objects. I think we should all value more kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners in each other. \n\nI agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. ",

Men and women evaluate one another on different standards, it's not an objective \"this woman is a 5 on everything and the man is a 6 on everything\".\n\nIt would help to be more clear and help each side understand the other better for sure though.\n\n>Getting just one is more than enough to be unhappy about it if it was creepy, meaning it scared her.\n\nAnd a woman getting one creepy approach every year for 10 years is still her getting approached 10x more by men than most men will ever be approached by women at all.\n\n>Most women are not flooded with attention— you’re only paying attention to the very hottest women.\n\nHow do we define flooded with attention though? Most women feel stared at, objectified, or creeped on by men at some point in their lives. Those are the things women tell men.\n\nMen basically never feel ever stared at, objectified, creeped on, approached by, appreciated, commented on, complimented on, or anything, ever, by the overwhelming majority of women in their lives. Most men feel completely and utterly invisible to women for the vast majority of their lives.\n\nIn contrast to men getting one compliment from random women a decade, women getting a random compliment a year or even a month, is being \"flooded\" with attention in comparison to what men are getting.\n\nMaybe you are considering \"flooded\" between the average woman and the most attractive women, but the average woman is still flooded with more attention than the vast majority of men will ever be. This I feel is what men mean when they say women are flooded with attention.\n\n> My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nThat's fair and I concede that. I was trying to say that when that argument is made, I believe that they mean to say \"in comparison to men\", even if they don't explicitly say it, because in comparison to men, it makes perfect sense.\n\n>That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\nTrue for free money out of nowhere, but if we define \"going on a date and having their meal paid for\", then yes, women get free money significantly more often than men. 1/3 of women polled on Tinder in Turkey admitted to going on dates with men they had no intention of dating, just for free meals. Women in N America have made posts about how they use dating to get free meals. \n\nNot all women, not all the time, but virtually every single time it does happen, it is practically always a woman, and practically always at the expense of men.\n\nWe can recognize not all women do this, and recognize that the overwhleming majority of people who do this and benefit from this, are women.\n\n>Like, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\nI'm not in the US so I genuinely do not know, do they actually shout that in public? How often does that happen?\n\n>I agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. \n\nAbsolutely. The commercialization of everything to make money off of everything, and devaluig of anything and everything you can't put a direct monetary value on, is causing enormous issues in society. We've forgotten that not everything that can be counted matters, and that not everything that matters can be counted.",

Meanwhile, the way ADHD presents in girls is often quieter, so it flies under the radar. Both issues exist, but only one gets sympathy.\n\nAs for school structure, order is necessary, but education systems are increasingly designed in ways that favour how girls typically learn—more emphasis on sitting still, listening, following structured assignments, and less on hands-on, competitive, or active learning that engages boys. That’s why boys are falling behind academically while girls are excelling. Ignoring that just ensures the gap keeps growing.\n\nYour understanding of \"women and children first\" still implies that men are expendable, which is exactly the point being made. And yes, we *do* need an explanation for why women *automatically* need more protection than men. Is female life inherently more valuable?

The idea that men could collectively shift the dating market through discipline is a fantasy just like telling women to stop chasing the top 10% of men wouldn’t work. The reality is, cultural and technological shifts (online dating, social media, career prioritisation) have changed the landscape in ways that overwhelmingly favor a small percentage of men and leave the rest struggling.\n\nIf men were simply failing on an individual level, we wouldn't see dating gaps increasing across the board. This is a systemic issue, not just personal failure. The solution isn't suppressing women’s rights, but it also isn’t gaslighting men into thinking their struggles are entirely self-inflicted. Society needs to acknowledge the imbalance instead of pretending men just need to \"cope better.\"",

When I heard my family members support her for speaking up and encouraging her to fight back I actually teared up.

When men point out that this is no longer a valid sentiment, they are shouted down and called names at worst, and just out of touch at best.\n\nThe mainstream media gets uneasy when it comes to discussing male suffering. It has no problem supporting women and people of color when they are struggling, and that is a beautiful thing, but what happens when it is men who are struggling?\n\nIn many cities of the US women under the age of 30 earn more than their male counterparts.\n\nAs of 2022, single women own 58% of homes by unmarried Americans, compared to 42% for single men.\n\nAlso as of fall 2022, 57.9% of postsecondary students were women. In 1970, this ratio was nearly identical in the opposite direction, and there was sufficient concern over the disparity that the US passed Title IX in 1972 to rectify it.\n\nIn the 2023–2024 academic year, 54.6% of medical students in the United States were women. In 2023, women made up 55.8% of the entering class of law students, up from 55.2% in 2022. Women have outnumbered men in law school classrooms for the past eight years in a row.\n\nMen account for somewhere between 70% and 84% of all homeless people. Men are four times as likely to commit suicide. These deaths of despair mostly affect working class men. \n\nIf any of the stats above had women as disadvantaged, there would be outrage and massive efforts to balance things. But since men are the ones affected, we turn a blind eye and tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

But regardless of how relevant these actions are, the current direct or indirect actions make the life of many men harder. Economically as well as sexually/relationship-wise. I think many men would welcome, if women and society would at least acknowledge the reality.

If it was **u/NoFatWomen4Me** I’d consider that a sexist username designed to reduce women to their sexual desirability, as though women’s value to society lies in their potential to please male partners, and as a reminder to women who don’t meet that standard that they are “less than.” \n\nPower discrepancies between men and women in a patriarchal society are relevant. But when people ignore actual (dis)advantages individuals face, then it’s just hate based on identity, which undercuts the actual foundation of progressivism, which is humanism. \n\nFeminism isn’t a monolith, but most people aren’t going to feminist book clubs or engaging with the nuance.

        "text": "I'd summarise it as \"we live in the 21st century, but pretend we're still in the 1960s\".\n\nThere are high expectations from men, but the social structure that allowed them to meet those expectations is long gone. For example, it is expected of men to provide for their household. It's unfortunately impossible now for the majority of people. On top of that, many women feel like they still work part-time jobs, so their men should bring \"real\" money. I know one woman with a salary of about $400k, who looks for a guy who earns more. Another expectation is being competent in approaching and courting women. It's hard for women to understand this, but a 17-18 years old guy doesn't naturally know how to do it.  \n\nThere is little support for men to meet these standards. Institutions support women with scholarships and employment opportunities. Families often leave their sons alone, because they think it's 1960s, and their son would be able to pay for his college with money from a summer job at a gas station.\n\nSo, your average guy faces some expectations and is not sure how to meet them. What adds another layer of problems is the standard narrative about masculinity. Growing up, the guy hears that traditional masculinity is bad,  that he shouldn't be aggressive, dominant, competitive, but better be compassionate, empathetic, and respectful. Then he sees that aggressive and dominant men get what they want, and no one generally gives a shit about your emotional availability. Also, there is this story about men who cause all the suffering. I get that men commit most violent crimes, but can we please have less of that rhetoric that \"men need to learn this, we need to teach men that\".\n\nFinally, it's difficult to talk about men's problems. Cannot get a date? Incel. Cannot get a good job? Loser. Many topics are just shrugged off. For example, the problem of false accusations of harassment. I often see an opinion that it's not even a problem to think of. Would you consider it a problem if your husband gets accused by a colleague with whom he competes for a promotion?",

Equality would mean women ought to do an equal share of the hard, heavy, and disgusting labour, that women are not entitled to privileged treatment and being treated like a princess, that women now should pay for half since women have careers and money as well, and that while men should shoulder more of the burdens inside the house, in turn she must also shoulder more of the burdens outside of the house as well. \n\n\nMost women would love to receive the former, and would hate to have to do most of the latter. Women largely have the privilege of choosing which parts of traditionalism and which parts of equality they want, while men are told to shut the fuck up, agree with her, and listen to what she wants. \n\n\nA huge part of equality that goes almost completely unaddressed and ignored is how women ought to emotionally support and encourage men as well, and recognizing how much emotional burden they place on men. As a society we're not even ready to have this conversation yet, because we haven't begun to realize how important men's feelings and emotions are in the first place. ",

As a society they are encouraged and empowered to do so regardless of the contradictions, hypocrisy, and difficulties it foists on men because society actively doesn't give a fuck about men. \n\n\nIndividual women may have more integrity and not choose buffet equality, but again it puts men at the mercy of women and whether or not that I dividual had integrity while the ones that don't are still empowered and entitled to demanding whatever they want from men while men are basically shamed for having any preferences. \n\n\nYou're not wrong, but this I feel is where you're not quite painting the full picture either. \n\n\nWe can't understand why young men feel disenfranchised if we can't paint an accurate picture of the situation young men are in. \n\n\nI largely agree with everything else you say, though the \"female nature\" stuff tends to be a direct refutal to the leftist/feminist dogma that men and women are identical blank slates at birth and that all gendered differences are due to socialization, and that biology does not in any way shape or form affect how people behave. The red pill pseudoscienfic nonsense is just as inaccurate as the feminist pseudo scientific nonsense, just pointing in the opposite direction. \n\n\nRed pill is a reaction to the situation that feminism has directly and actively set up. ",

Strangers consistently tell them how beautiful they are, buy them things, give them money, etc. This creates women who have huge egos and feel entitled to special treatment by men; it also creates women who are narcissists and have a princess complex.\n\nIf he thinks this happens to anything other than a tiny minority of women, he’s falling for the apex fallacy.  And if he does actually understand that this is just the tiny minority of 8+/10 women, then it’s pretty rich for him to be pissed off she’s not dating 5/10s when he’s so hypergamous himself.\n\n>something that constantly and consistently happens to women to their benefit,\n\nIt doesn’t constantly and consistently happen to **women**.  It constantly and consistently happens only to the really hot women you care about.  You don’t even notice that the rest of us even exist.  We are fully invisible to guys like you.\n\nIt is always truly so flattering when men online insist that any woman who isn’t “constantly and consistently” swamped with flattery and male attention is just fucking ugly.  Thanks for the unintentional insult, bro.",

My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nYou could only believe that’s the average woman’s experience in life if you think 9/10 women are average.  That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\n>while on contrast the vast majority of women will never simp for any man less than a 7.\n\nAgain, still off topic. Not one thing I said was to claim anything about men’s experiences in dating.  I am correcting the false belief that 5/10 women are treated like celebrities.  They’re not.   I’m not claiming they’re incels(what you seem to assume i said), but that men aren’t buying them free gifts and calling them gorgeous randomly on the street.  \n\nLike, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\n>I also think that our society has several unhealthy attitudes valuing women too much on their looks alone and valuing men too much on their achievements alone. It dehumanize both women and men in different ways, women as beauty objects and men as success objects. I think we should all value more kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners in each other. \n\nI agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. ",

For a relationship, they don’t actually date down the way men here insist men do.\n\nYou know that's actually fair, and is one thing that men should clarify, that while standards for ONS and starting a relationship are low, standards to have a long-term partner are high, as they should be. \n\n>And if you really think men are always dating “down”… don’t you find that kind of awful?   \n\nMen date \"up\" in terms of appearance because they want a woman who is good looking, where women tend to say they don't care as much about men's appearance.  Men and women evaluate one another on different standards, it's not an objective \"this woman is a 5 on everything and the man is a 6 on everything\".\n\nIt would help to be more clear and help each side understand the other better for sure though.\n\n>Getting just one is more than enough to be unhappy about it if it was creepy, meaning it scared her.\n\nAnd a woman getting one creepy approach every year for 10 years is still her getting approached 10x more by men than most men will ever be approached by women at all.\n\n>Most women are not flooded with attention— you’re only paying attention to the very hottest women.\n\nHow do we define flooded with attention though? Most women feel stared at, objectified, or creeped on by men at some point in their lives. Those are the things women tell men.\n\nMen basically never feel ever stared at, objectified, creeped on, approached by, appreciated, commented on, complimented on, or anything, ever, by the overwhelming majority of women in their lives. Most men feel completely and utterly invisible to women for the vast majority of their lives.\n\nIn contrast to men getting one compliment from random women a decade, women getting a random compliment a year or even a month, is being \"flooded\" with attention in comparison to what men are getting.\n\nMaybe you are considering \"flooded\" between the average woman and the most attractive women, but the average woman is still flooded with more attention than the vast majority of men will ever be. This I feel is what men mean when they say women are flooded with attention.\n\n> My entire claim is to say that it is totally inaccurate to say most women, or average women are constantly getting tons of strangers calling them beautiful and throwing money at them.\n\nThat's fair and I concede that. I was trying to say that when that argument is made, I believe that they mean to say \"in comparison to men\", even if they don't explicitly say it, because in comparison to men, it makes perfect sense.\n\n>That’s not how normal women live  their lives, getting free money and simp behavior constantly.  \n\nTrue for free money out of nowhere, but if we define \"going on a date and having their meal paid for\", then yes, women get free money significantly more often than men. 1/3 of women polled on Tinder in Turkey admitted to going on dates with men they had no intention of dating, just for free meals. Women in N America have made posts about how they use dating to get free meals. \n\nNot all women, not all the time, but virtually every single time it does happen, it is practically always a woman, and practically always at the expense of men.\n\nWe can recognize not all women do this, and recognize that the overwhleming majority of people who do this and benefit from this, are women.\n\n>Like, in the US, the average woman is fat.  Men shout “land whale” at fat women, not “you’re beautiful”.\n\nI'm not in the US so I genuinely do not know, do they actually shout that in public? How often does that happen?\n\n>I agree that would be great, sure.  We also as a society just plain value money too much over kindness, humility, consideration, and good manners. \n\nAbsolutely. The commercialization of everything to make money off of everything, and devaluig of anything and everything you can't put a direct monetary value on, is causing enormous issues in society. We've forgotten that not everything that can be counted matters, and that not everything that matters can be counted.",

Boys' natural behaviours—higher energy, impulsivity, and physicality—lead to more suspensions, disciplinary actions, and misdiagnoses, which negatively affects their education and self-perception. Meanwhile, the way ADHD presents in girls is often quieter, so it flies under the radar. Both issues exist, but only one gets sympathy.\n\nAs for school structure, order is necessary, but education systems are increasingly designed in ways that favour how girls typically learn—more emphasis on sitting still, listening, following structured assignments, and less on hands-on, competitive, or active learning that engages boys. That’s why boys are falling behind academically while girls are excelling. Ignoring that just ensures the gap keeps growing.\n\nYour understanding of \"women and children first\" still implies that men are expendable, which is exactly the point being made. And yes, we *do* need an explanation for why women *automatically* need more protection than men. Is female life inherently more valuable? If so, doesn’t that contradict the entire idea of gender equality? Either we treat both sexes equally, or we admit we don’t actually believe in equality.",

Instead of working with boys’ energy levels and tendencies, the system punishes them for not learning like girls do.

The idea that men could collectively shift the dating market through discipline is a fantasy just like telling women to stop chasing the top 10% of men wouldn’t work. The reality is, cultural and technological shifts (online dating, social media, career prioritisation) have changed the landscape in ways that overwhelmingly favor a small percentage of men and leave the rest struggling.\n\nIf men were simply failing on an individual level, we wouldn't see dating gaps increasing across the board. This is a systemic issue, not just personal failure. The solution isn't suppressing women’s rights, but it also isn’t gaslighting men into thinking their struggles are entirely self-inflicted. Society needs to acknowledge the imbalance instead of pretending men just need to \"cope better.\"",

There are obvious correct ways and to approach a woman and court her. Of course methods that deviate from this would cause alarm and be reprimanded. \n\nOne personal example I can think of is how I would be told that boys in my class pulled my hair bc they liked me (Is this the boyishness you speak of?). I was even told this by teachers! Now the young girls in my family are taken more seriously when such things happen to them and the boys are dealt with. When I heard my family members support her for speaking up and encouraging her to fight back I actually teared up. Because these were the same family members who told me to just ignore them or treat it as a compliment growing up. \n\nSo I don’t think our system is emasculating men. I think it is starting to not excuse disorderly behavior for the sake of “men being men”. I don’t see how that’s a problem.
