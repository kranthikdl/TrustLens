"Then that's the crux of the matter right there. Heaven forbid if you have a kid with a great question that leads to a teachable moment. Heaven forbid if you find a better way to teach a concept than what is in the scripted curriculum. 

Scripted curricula don't require teachers of any particular knowledge or skill level. They're often instituted because of some warped concept of parity: if we don't teach kids the exact same material in the precise same way in the same span of time, then learning isn't equitable, this idiot concept says. Kids aren't widgets on an assembly line. They have varying needs, skills, abilities, and interests. 

There's another reason for instituting this curricula: it doesn't require teachers of any particular knowledge, education, or skill level. This allows districts and states to hire people who have none of those things and who will work for minimum wage. It's easy!

"Well maybe your kids are just so amazing that you really charged through the script, in completion of course, and you, being the amazing teacher that you are, were able to keep them calm, working, and happy with your quick thinking skills to have them work on a craft to enhance their fine motor skills, supplementing your handwriting curriculum, as well as knowing that your students need extra support in these fine motor skills, so you had an amazing group of volunteers come in to assist you. 

But for real- the ‘last 30 mins’ crowd doesn’t know that kindergartners are a hot mess at party time and it takes time. The people doing walk-throughs the last hour of Halloween are a bunch of jerks. The people who set your school to a scripted curriculum are out of touch. 

But the people who came into your class and experienced that marvelous time with you and your babies? You made an amazing connection with them and they saw you as a real human who cares for their precious little ones. And your babies made a core memory to take on with them in their sea of scripted awfulness for the rest of their educational life. 

Maybe your parents can do some good trouble and start some pushback on the scripted curriculum when they find out that their kids aren’t allowed to have time to not be educational robots.

Ultimately the kids are at school to learn and our job is to teach them, and from a legal/admin standpoint, schools are bound to a certain number of instructional minutes.

Because of admin stance, I've told my students that we will never have a party in my class, but if they keep their grades up, I will frequently allow them to have ""free time with snacks"".  

Seriously, though, even high school kids need to let loose sometimes too. An occasional class period of ""free time with snacks"" goes a long way towards easing up on some of the stress that the daily curriculum push puts them under. As far as other teachers partying, that's not an issue unless you make it one. If students are allowed to let loose in one class, then at least they have a chance to get it out of their system before they come to yours.

Is instructional time in your classroom not *some* fun? Not at all??

And from your own telling of the story, the issue is clearly not a matter of completely banning any ""fun"" party time. ""20-30 minutes"" would have been completely fine, according to you.

Obviously, closing the textbooks and going off-script isn't necessarily bad. Kids need breaks and some variety just as much as they need discipline and structure. *Some* party time is obviously good, but someone has to draw the line because time is preciously scarce.
