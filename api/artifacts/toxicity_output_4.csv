So I have this friend ""Scotty"" (Fake name). We enjoy hanging out a lot, but our conversation left me stunned and disgusted. It was on the weekend, we were watching netflix whilst he got a little buzzed ( I don't drink for both religious and personal reasons) and he basically admitted to me that he enjoys sleeping with married women/women in committed relationships. 

I was pretty shocked, one because that's an incredibly shitty thing to do and two because whenever infidelity would come up he would always say how much he hated cheaters, how they were all terrible people who deserved to be punished etc. (so cheating is bad, but *helping* people cheat is fine? Ok bud.)

I immediately told him he was gross and a hypocrite but then he got all defensive and said that he never ""made any vows"" and that those women were ""probably going to cheat anyway."" He also made the point that it's better since it's less hassle and he doesn't have the expectations of a relationship. It got quite disturbing when he got into how much fun seducing them was and how he was making them feel things that their husbands never did etc. 

I told him to leave. He cussed me out and told our mutual friends how I was ""judging"" him for his lifestyle.  Some of them are on my side whilst a few are saying that's it's not my business and that I should let him be stupid and make mistakes whilst he is still young. One of them, a male cousin whom I respect and look up to, told me that Scotty's not the one ruining the marriages, the married women are and that I shouldn't blame him.

Obviously I want to cut Scotty out of my life but I'm feeling conflicted after hearing what my cousin and others had to say so idk, any thoughts?

"The women share responsibility, but to say he's not responsible is false. Everyone has moments of weakness, none of us are saints. Most of us could probably be swayed to do something wrong if the right person made the right argument at the right time. This guy mentions that he seduces women, so it's not like these are women who are throwing themselves at him - they're clearly in a weakened state, and he's exploiting that weakness.

Put it another way: if my wife cheated on me with another man, and I found out that guy had been soliciting my wife for weeks or months? You damn well bet that guy is not going to be blameless in my mind.

The alternative would be a virtuous man who tries to remind women who are interested in him that they should work things out in their own relationship. A more twisted form of virtue would be someone who feels he's helping women to realize their desires, and to recognize that they're unhappy in their relationships. But that's not what this guy is doing. He's claiming cheaters are terrible, and is then encouraging acts of infidelity while making them real. Like it or not, he's a cheater, too.

"OP idk if you’ll see this considering there’s so many comments but I had a best friend like this for 5 years. The longer I knew her I realized how bad of a person she was. She had zero morals (among other things she did I had issues with). She cheated in every single relationship she was in as well. 

She slept with everyone’s boyfriends, even her “best friends” boyfriends. Never came clean unless caught red handed. She never even felt bad about it either and always found some way to justify it or would just say stuff like “I was just being shitty hehe” but with like a “whoops” kinda attitude. 

And then ofc she had the audacity to call all these woman “crazy” when they reached out to her about her sleeping with their man, and she always denied it to protect herself. She also never got tested and spread STD’s to others and didn’t care at all, she never disclosed anything. She was a very pretty girl so everyone wanted to fuck her/did fuck her. 

I was naive most of our friendship thinking I was special enough to her that she wouldn’t do that to me. All it took was me going to the bathroom and leaving her around my bf (now ex) for her to start talking sexual to him behind my back.

It took me a long time to cut her off completely because we were such close friends, but I knew deep down I could never trust her. After that incident she never met any of my future boyfriends ever again. She also would confide in me looking for sympathy in all these situations and I always told her she was in the wrong. “It takes 2 to tango” was always one of her excuses as well.

Your friend has questionable moral integrity. No one is perfect, but this is a pretty deep one. He will not think twice about screwing you over.

When you know they are taken you should not try to actively seduce them. If you are passive and she actively tries to seduce you I would probably care less though.

I have slept with a taken woman before and I am not proud of it... There is nothing to gain for either side. Even if they break up after this she gets together with you, you have a cheating partner. But you could even argue that you save the guys. Weird thought but here and there you see videos where women ask other girls to test if their boyfriends would cheat.

He just adds to the negative stereotypes all guys then suffer for",yellow,0.47449561059474943,0.6778508722782135,0.0,Repeated punctuation.,0.3221491277217865,0.001910506747663021,0.18563500046730042,0.0008705187356099486,0.027551136910915375,0.0027874570805579424,0,0,0,0,0,0
