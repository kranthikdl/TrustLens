    "Well, it certainly seems that way. This is why I have such a hard time committing to these extremely expensive sofas from online companies.",
    "Yes/no. The sofas produced for Article are specified by Article for particular features, like frame material, construction technique, upholstery specs, etc. The Alibaba replicas are likely out of the same factory but with crappier specs. They do the same for clothing. Same looks, different guts.\n\nSource: have been to Asia on buying / spec trips.\n\nEdit : not saying that Article *isn't* garbage, just a slightly better quality of low quality.",
    "According to [an interview the founders did with Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2018/02/05/modern-design-no-retail-markup-furniture-maker-article-forecasts-200-million-in-2018-sales/#65a08642b389) they had gone to China to see supply chains for themselves. “A typical retail markup, Andy Prochazka says, is 400% over the factory cost, meaning a sofa that sells for $2,000 costs just $500 to make” — which is basically exactly what they’re doing. Maybe slightly less profit. \n\nI guess who isn’t doing this no matter where you go, whether it’s Article or RH!",
    "To be clear, 400% over factory is nothing. If it's $500 out the overseas factory door, you're not making much, if anything, selling it for $2000 retail in North America. At that rate, you're lucky to have anything left for after sales support.\n\nWho isn't doing this are heritage brands and your local.",
    "Right. You can buy one out of the factory in Viet Nam or whatever, but you've still got to ship it.  It's a lot cheaper per unit to ship 500 than one, and that's where the retailer's profit lies.  Sure, you can buy one, but by the time you get it home you end up spending just as much.",
    "And then you have to add in shipping cost, salaries, employee benefits, rents, taxes, marketing materials, product development, research... I could go on and on. Just because things are made overseas doesn’t mean that the quality is lacking. The machines alone are a huge cost and need constant maintenance. \n\nIve worked in home goods product development.",
    "A [twitter user helpfully pointed out this thread](https://twitter.com/EdmundCLo/status/1283301838389837824). I can categorically state that we are not a fancy dropshipping website (source: I am the Director of Marketing). \n\nWe do not work with any of these sellers/suppliers. \n\nFor a start, only one of the products that you have listed is manufactured in China (the Ceni), the other 6 are manufactured in Vietnam - so not even the country of origin is correct. \n\nThis is an ongoing problem we (and many other brands) have with marketplace merchants, particularly on Alibaba. They will take our photography -- both our studio shots and our location photography -- and represent it as their own product. Alibaba has a takedown process, however this tends to be a bit like playing whack-a-mole. When one is taken down, a whole bunch of other pop up. \n\nI have no idea what would show up if you ordered from any of these sellers, but can assure you it would not be Article product. If anyone does order from one of these sellers I would be very interested to see hear/see what happens. \n\nAside from these listings definitively not being Article product, there are a couple of other facts I would point to to refute the assertion that we are a \"fancy dropshipper\":\n\n* We operate 5 of our own warehouse locations across the US and Canada with more than 1M square feet of warehouse space. \n* We operate our own delivery teams (Article employees driving Article trucks) in 7 major markets, with more to come. \n* We have a team of more than 400 across the US and Canada. This includes a talented and hard working team of product designers, developers, and managers, as well as a creative team that produces all our photography and video in-house, It is incredibly frustrating to have their work passed off as someone else's. \n\nWhat is particularly disappointing about this rumour is that Article was founded precisely because the markup between manufacturing and retail in the furniture industry was absurd. By not operating showrooms, and sourcing our product direct from manufacturers (rather than export agents etc.) we are able to pass on our savings to customers. \n\nWe are confident that we offer unrivalled value.",
    "Genuinely curious because I work in advertising and I've seen a handful of furniture company employees on this sub who tend to promote their company--are you on reddit to gather qual data on Article? Is there feedback from here that you take to your marketing team, whether its around the stuff said about Article or your competitor? Or does Reddit serve another purpose",
    "Happy to answer. There are a few reasons that my team and I keep an eye on what is going on on reddit:\n\n* Looking at how often we come up unaided as a recommendation for people who have questions about where to shop/source various product.\n* Unprompted/unvarnished feedback on our products and service.\n* Seeing how people style our product in their space -- there are a few subs where people often share pics of their spaces.\n* General insight into how people are shopping for furniture and what they want -- how they make choices of where to shop or what pieces to choose (or at least how they explain those choices to others).\n\nObviously it is one of many qual sources we look at, but I find it pretty useful.\n\nAs you'll see from my profile, it is pretty rare that I post. Think this is my first post in this sub, and really only because it was being referenced in that discussion I had on twitter. I only ever post to address very false/misleading info, or offer support to a customer that has clearly slipped through our support network somehow.\n\nWorth noting we have a strict policy to identify ourselves as employees when posting on reddit (or any other forum). Want to make sure we respect the community.\n\nHope that answers your question.",
    "Late to the game, but I appreciate your comment.",
    "This is nuts! How did you match them up? They all have generic descriptions which is annoying. For what it’s worth, their top recommendation for a [stool](https://m.alibaba.com/product/62514489808/modern-high-counter-bar-stools-with.html?s=p) looks suspiciously like a pricey, designer made (and “manufactured in China”) [About a Stool](https://us.hay.com/furniture/seating/stools/about-a-stool-32-counter-stool/100128012.html?)",
    "Everything I’ve bought from article is super high quality. Can’t say the same about the lookalikes.",
    "Ah I guess their site does say China. At least they’re transparent. https://www.article.com/faq",
    "Looks about right. Even some chain stores are reselling this cheap crap nowadays. If you don’t mind the quality it may even work out to import it yourself, lol.",
    "Do you have to purchase multiple of these items or can purchase 1 or 2?",
    "Let's start a site that aggregates buyers at cost when a threshold is met...\n\nEscrow until or get your money back...",
    "sounds like massdrop :p",
    "Can someone help me find the solae chill white corner modular sofa piece dupe? Article stopped selling it and I’m desperate to find it.",

I can categorically state that we are not a fancy dropshipping website (source: I am the Director of Marketing). \n\nWe do not work with any of these sellers/suppliers. \n\nFor a start, only one of the products that you have listed is manufactured in China (the Ceni), the other 6 are manufactured in Vietnam - so not even the country of origin is correct. \n\nThis is an ongoing problem we (and many other brands) have with marketplace merchants, particularly on Alibaba. They will take our photography -- both our studio shots and our location photography -- and represent it as their own product. Alibaba has a takedown process, however this tends to be a bit like playing whack-a-mole. When one is taken down, a whole bunch of other pop up. \n\nI have no idea what would show up if you ordered from any of these sellers, but can assure you it would not be Article product. If anyone does order from one of these sellers I would be very interested to see hear/see what happens. \n\nAside from these listings definitively not being Article product, there are a couple of other facts I would point to to refute the assertion that we are a \"fancy dropshipper\":\n\n* We operate 5 of our own warehouse locations across the US and Canada with more than 1M square feet of warehouse space. \n* We operate our own delivery teams (Article employees driving Article trucks) in 7 major markets, with more to come. \n* We have a team of more than 400 across the US and Canada. This includes a talented and hard working team of product designers, developers, and managers, as well as a creative team that produces all our photography and video in-house, It is incredibly frustrating to have their work passed off as someone else's. \n\nWhat is particularly disappointing about this rumour is that Article was founded precisely because the markup between manufacturing and retail in the furniture industry was absurd. By not operating showrooms, and sourcing our product direct from manufacturers (rather than export agents etc.) we are able to pass on our savings to customers. \n\nWe are confident that we offer unrivalled value.",

There are a few reasons that my team and I keep an eye on what is going on on reddit:\n\n* Looking at how often we come up unaided as a recommendation for people who have questions about where to shop/source various product.\n* Unprompted/unvarnished feedback on our products and service.\n* Seeing how people style our product in their space -- there are a few subs where people often share pics of their spaces.\n* General insight into how people are shopping for furniture and what they want -- how they make choices of where to shop or what pieces to choose (or at least how they explain those choices to others).\n\nObviously it is one of many qual sources we look at, but I find it pretty useful.\n\nAs you'll see from my profile, it is pretty rare that I post. Think this is my first post in this sub, and really only because it was being referenced in that discussion I had on twitter. I only ever post to address very false/misleading info, or offer support to a customer that has clearly slipped through our support network somehow.\n\nWorth noting we have a strict policy to identify ourselves as employees when posting on reddit (or any other forum). Want to make sure we respect the community.\n\nHope that answers your question.",

I can categorically state that we are not a fancy dropshipping website (source: I am the Director of Marketing). \n\nWe do not work with any of these sellers/suppliers. \n\nFor a start, only one of the products that you have listed is manufactured in China (the Ceni), the other 6 are manufactured in Vietnam - so not even the country of origin is correct. \n\nThis is an ongoing problem we (and many other brands) have with marketplace merchants, particularly on Alibaba. They will take our photography -- both our studio shots and our location photography -- and represent it as their own product. Alibaba has a takedown process, however this tends to be a bit like playing whack-a-mole. When one is taken down, a whole bunch of other pop up. \n\nI have no idea what would show up if you ordered from any of these sellers, but can assure you it would not be Article product. If anyone does order from one of these sellers I would be very interested to see hear/see what happens. \n\nAside from these listings definitively not being Article product, there are a couple of other facts I would point to to refute the assertion that we are a \"fancy dropshipper\":\n\n* We operate 5 of our own warehouse locations across the US and Canada with more than 1M square feet of warehouse space. \n* We operate our own delivery teams (Article employees driving Article trucks) in 7 major markets, with more to come. \n* We have a team of more than 400 across the US and Canada. This includes a talented and hard working team of product designers, developers, and managers, as well as a creative team that produces all our photography and video in-house, It is incredibly frustrating to have their work passed off as someone else's. \n\nWhat is particularly disappointing about this rumour is that Article was founded precisely because the markup between manufacturing and retail in the furniture industry was absurd. By not operating showrooms, and sourcing our product direct from manufacturers (rather than export agents etc.) we are able to pass on our savings to customers. \n\nWe are confident that we offer unrivalled value.",

There are a few reasons that my team and I keep an eye on what is going on on reddit:\n\n* Looking at how often we come up unaided as a recommendation for people who have questions about where to shop/source various product.\n* Unprompted/unvarnished feedback on our products and service.\n* Seeing how people style our product in their space -- there are a few subs where people often share pics of their spaces.\n* General insight into how people are shopping for furniture and what they want -- how they make choices of where to shop or what pieces to choose (or at least how they explain those choices to others).\n\nObviously it is one of many qual sources we look at, but I find it pretty useful.\n\nAs you'll see from my profile, it is pretty rare that I post. Think this is my first post in this sub, and really only because it was being referenced in that discussion I had on twitter. I only ever post to address very false/misleading info, or offer support to a customer that has clearly slipped through our support network somehow.\n\nWorth noting we have a strict policy to identify ourselves as employees when posting on reddit (or any other forum).
