    "NAH. It’s recommended you get to the airport about 3 hours before an international flight. I’d compromise and do that instead. \n\nEDIT TO ADD- I missed that OP is flying out in the next couple of days so the 4 hours makes more sense in context since TSA is still recovering from the government shutdown. My judgment is still NAH but 4 hours makes more sense.",
    "Not with LAX. With LAX, you go in as early as you can go, because even that way, you'll end up running to make it, and your flight will leave late on schedule.",
    "I'm not a frequent flier, but i flew in and out of LAX earlier this year. Worst TSA screening process. Still had to take off shoes, take out liquids. Even had to take food out of my bag. Took forever. And that was before the shutdown!",
    "It's honestly a traumatizing place. I have literally _zero_ flight anxiety, but the mere thought of that airport gives me palpitations.\n\nIf I have a choice, no way I'm going through there.",
    "I now understand why it was so much cheaper to use LAX than the other area airports.",
    "Anytime you can fly out of Long Beach do it it’s so chill",
    "Burbank also",
    "Depending on what part of LA you’re in, Ontario is also a super chill airport.",
    "I almost had a complete breakdown one time coming into lax on international when my flight was late so got to customs at the same time as a bunch of a380s from Asia came in.   I swear I’m getting hives just recalling the madness 🥴",
    "I never thought about having multiple of those A380s arrive at the same time and the impact it has on customs. Two full flights would be upwards of 1000 passengers at one time!!!",
    "Yep and everyone cranky and tired after 10+ hours on a plane.  Complete chaos 🥴",
    "I will die in the hill that LAX is the worst airport in the world, and I’ve been to Lisbon.",
    "When my daughter was a toddler I took her to the bathroom in LAX while my husband got the bags and she, being from Singapore, looked up at me with worry and said, “mommy, what’s wrong with this airport?” Yeah, good question, kid.",
    "That’s hilarious. Even the kids know.",
    "Noooooo - I'm flying into Lisbon in May to walk the Camino and I'm not thrilled to hear this lol\n\nBut I fly a LOT - I've been Diamond or Platinum with Delta for almost 16 years due to work travel - and I absolutely agree that LAX is the WORST.\n\nNTA",
    "I am so jealous of your Camino adventure!!",
    "Things are kind of falling into place. I'm 55F, just coming out of an (awful) 30+ year marriage, and need a bit of a reset. Then my mom passed away and left me a little money and the Camino had been kicking around in my head for a while so....it seemed like a sign.",
    "I will die with you on this hill. I always get to international flights 3 hours early and I almost missed an LAX flight because we sat in LAX traffic for 2 hours!! Also OP baggage check in closes early for international flights.",
    "I don’t even know about Lisbon, but this comment tells me everything I need to know thank you",
    "Same! Flying no problem. Getting through stupid TSA, almost an anxiety attack",
    "I have precheck but I feel like LAX is fine? SeaTac is the worst though.",
    "Newark is worse.",
    "Newark is so bad I’ll pay extra to avoid flying through there",
    "Jersey resident here. Can confirm Newark is awful. The shutdown made it even more of a nightmare. I have a few friends who got so sick of flight delays into and out of it that they just rented cars to get where they needed to go. One was in Florida and decided to drive all the way back to Jersey rather than wait for delays.",
    "Newark is so bad, that United messaged me last May  asking  me to change my flight to Newark,  and it wd be no charge.     and we did, we flew in to a different airport instead.",
    "Honestly, I fly into/out of EWR and LAX fairly often and they're fine. You just need TSA precheck and you'll be good.\n\nCDG, on the other hand, has always been a mess every time I've flown into/out of there.",
    "CDG is satans taint. The miles and miles of walking with no services anywhere, and the GLACIAL customs lines. Ugh.",
    "Not to mention I had to go through security way more than I felt like I should have. I feel like I went through screening at least twice.\n\nI've never been through LAX, but it can't be worse than CDG. CDG is so dogshit, I had to go to another airport to leave France one time.",
    "I've flown out of Newark 3x and never had an issue. I get through security in maybe 30 minutes.",
    "Agreed that SeaTac is absolutely worse.",
    "This is true. I left myself a three hour layover at LAX to transfer from an international flight from Japan to a domestic US flight. \n\nIt was only enough time because the domestic flight was late. That airport is a nightmare that just gets worse with each passing year.",
    "We had the same coming from Japan to Detroit - the layover was HOURS at LAX. There were enough seats for about 20% of the people waiting, everyone else was on the floor. The seats had these boxes under the armrest so you could charge your phone but it wasn’t working when I plugged mine in. I looked inside and there was nothing - no wires, just an empty space with an outlet cover. \nI would pay extra to skip LAX at any given opportunity.",
    "To be honest, transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight is a whole different animal than just showing up to leave on an intl flight. Because you never know how many other intl flights are arriving around the same time to make the customs/immigration lines long, you can't really compare it to a simple departure.",
    "I must be lucky last week.  I had a 3h 30m layover at LAX to transfer from a flight from Brisbane to an AA flight to Chicago. I breezed through immigration thanks to Global Entry. Waiting to claim luggage took longer. I then dropped off my luggage before going through TSA for the domestic flight. I had nearly an hour to spare before boarding my onward flight. All in all, the transfer through LAX was much smoother than expected.",
    "They're probably flying out of Bradly. It's not that bad.",
    "Unless you get stuck in the horseshoe for an ungodly amount of time.   There are no shortcuts to TBIT.",
    "This happened to me. I missed the ramp to my parking lot and it took 40 minutes to get back around the loop. Cut my 3 hour lead time down to a little over 2. Super stressful.",
    "Yeah. It’s not about what happens *after* you arrive at LAX, it’s about getting there. \n\nOnce you’re standing inside of the airport terminal, two hours is plenty of time to make it to the departure gate. But it can take anywhere from 1-2 hours to actually get yourself into the airport from ~30 miles away. \n\nFrom San Diego we give ourselves three hours to get to the airport, even though it shouldn’t take more than two hours travel time. Traffic can soak up an extra hour, easily, unless you’re getting into your car at 3 am.",
    "It really isnt. I dont understand all the hate. LAX is ny home airport and I fly 8-10x annually.",
    "I've been in much worse international terminals than Bradley. Though I wish the aisles between the ticket counters were wider. When there are a lot of flights going out around the same time and a lot of passengers needing to check in that area can be a circus.",
    "There is the saying for those of us in OC of \"friends don't let friends fly from LAX\" or \"friends don't ask friends for rides to/from LAX\". \n\nWe luckily have SNA (by California Disney) which has become a decent sized airport now and is very chill. It's like a less nice and larger version of Paine-Everett, the airport just north of Seattle (about 1.5hr north of SeaTac depending on traffic). \n\nThat airport is the cutest little amazing airport, NGL. It used to be a private airport and still has all the fancy chairs, amazing views, a beechers (the cheese place), and just extremely quick and easy TSA. I don't live in Seattle anymore, so I don't feel bad spilling this secret. ;)",
    "True that. LAX is an absolutely awful airport.",
    "Just jumping on the top comment, if he can go to his gp and either get valium or a beta blocker, that will assist greatly with his anxiety.",
    "Beta blockers are so great for this type of anxiety. And they don’t make you sleepy.",
    "Isn't sleepiness generally a welcome side effect for an anti-anxiety medication during an international flight?",
    "Depends on when you have to take the medication. Sounds like the husband needs it before they get to the airport, so better one that won't make him sleepy when OP is trying to get them through security and to their gate.",
    "I take Lorazepam before a flight to keep me from freaking out during the times you're not allowed to use the bathroom (IBS). It's kind of a bonus for the sleepiness, IMO.",
    "He is an asshole making op feel anxious and likely to miss her flight. And not doing anything for the trip in the first place. He can go there late himself but he can’t guilt op to wait around just for him ",
    "Agreed. But also, rushing through an airport and stressing about being late is definitely not what you want if you're already anxious about the flight. Imagine the anxiety of rushing and running through the airport and then immediately jumping on the plane. Sounds like a nightmare. Someone with flying anxiety should want a relaxing stroll and calm experience to prepare to get on the plane. \n\nIt sounds like he doesn't want to go on this trip at all.",
    "The return flight of my first trip by plane I nearly had a meltdown in the car on our way to the airport. Because due to delays not caused by me we were going to be there 1.5h before our intercontinental flight left and I was sure we were going to miss it. Can not recommend. If you're anxious get there on time so you have one less thing to stress about and instead distract yourself wandering around the airport.",
    "Yeah this was my thought. My partner has anxiety and hasn’t flown as much as me and always wants to go to the airport crazy early so he doesn’t have to stress. If it was him and me flying out of LAX he’d be arguing for 4 and I’d be saying 3 was enough.",
    "3 hours is the convention so I have no idea why the 2 vs 4 hrs ahead debate.\n\nAlso, traffic TO LAX, give extra time.\n\nEdit *TO (fixed thank you for highlighting this error)",
    "Absolutely here is where extra time should be added. I've never had a problem with two to two and a half hours in LAX as long as you're focused in the way you're doing. The will find you in line if the security lines are too big and your flight's getting ready to go as long as you've been in the airport for a while. But the drive there I would be way more working that angle because one and a half hours could be three",
    "I was told 2 hrs domestic, 4 hrs international.",
    "I've seen airports where they tell you not to show up more than three hours before your flight, due to crowding.  Now, if OP has to get through LA traffic during the morning commute, there's something to be said by aiming to arrive by 7:30am, before it's at its worst.\n\n\\[Edit for typo.\\]",
    "TO*",
    "Thank you I’ve amended.  \nUzually I are literit.",
    "I'd do 5. They're going in Los Angeles morning traffic, and there's a government shutdown. The guy who's never flown intentionally before it's crazy being this risky just to avoid having breakfast in the airport.",
    "If he can't handle his anxiety to sit in an airport for a few hours, what would missing the flight do to it?! NTA",
    "Maybe that's his goal! He's secretly hoping that he doesn't have to get on the plane and go on this trip at all...\n\n\nI agree that 4 hours is a bit much normally for international flights, but with LA traffic and the shutdown, it makes sense.  \nNTA",
    "Jumping on top comment. NAH. I’m a frequent international flyer. Assuming no TSA pre check I’d say at least 3 hours. Why not compromise a little. Get a hotel, this way you don’t have to worry about traffic and you can start the trip a night early",
    "This is brilliant-and a great tip! Airports always have a hotel right on premises- 🙌 winning comment. That cuts so much stress",
    "i agree its perfect since they can meet in the middle and honestly the only way to go",
    "NAH, agreed. The airport hotel the night before is a great idea, also see if you can get a day pass to the lounge before your flight. They are sooooo much more calm and relaxing than sitting at the gate next to a Hudson News and some sports bar.",
    "That’s on a normal day. With the shut downs I’d go even earlier than that. People are reporting being there even five and six hours and not making their flights at the moment. \n\nOP is your husband ok with missing the flight because he went too late? If he did miss the flight would he be ok with you flying anyway without him? If he is then I’d compromise and go early and get as much done as possible on your end while keeping him posted on how long it’s taking so he can make a more informed decision. Like go four hours (or more early yourself and if you breeze through security then he can wait to show up. If you get stuck in a very long security line then he had better hightail it to the airport.",
    "Why would they drive separately from an hour and a half away?",
    "Especially an impacted airport rn, I’d reckon at least 3 hours. LAX is such a shit show usually that if security won’t bite your ass, it’ll be a last minute hate/terminal change.",
    "Plus, with all of the cancelled flights and general chaos around travel these days, honestly, I don’t think the four-hour plan is outrageous. Also, she should tell him that all psychological and social evidence shows that having a longer lead time, which means no stressful running between terminals etc., should lead to feeling *less* anxious before the flight. I’m an anxious flyer myself, and have found that it’s actually helpful to my state of mind to end up bored at the airport while waiting to depart.",
    "Ya you can't even check on a lot of places until 3 hours before the flight anyways.",
    "Can you stay at an airport hotel the night before your flight so you are very close to the airport, don't have to worry abt traffic and he can chill in the calm room a bit later in the morning?",
    "I live in San Diego county. This is what my friends do. Many of the hotels offer discounts for parking & will shuttle you to the airport. It takes so much stress off.",
    "not a paid promotion, just a grateful user. \n\nParksleepfly.com is a god send for this. I use it when flying out of SFO and way cheaper parking.",
    "I like this idea.  Have breakfast at the hotel, and then head over.  No traffic concerns, no need to be in the airport extra early for breakfast, just head over ~3hrs before the flight.",
    "You can probably even check your bags the night before and put a change of clothes in your carry-on.",
    "Typically US airports will only let you check bags for your flight a couple hours before departure, but I do really enjoy this as a concept!!",
    "I am anxious the way OP is. Like i am not anxious about flying itself but the whole airport stresses me out. Arriving in time, security etc. This year I went from Germany to Mexico and I stayed one night at the airport hotel in Frankfurt. Seriously a flight day was never this little stress to me before ever. DO THIS OP!!",
    "I went the the Bahamas for a work trip a few years ago, which meant an overnight in Miami both ways. We stayed in the airport hotel both nights and it was so easy to catch our flights the next day, no stress about being on time, worrying about traffic etc etc.",
    "Same, I can’t relax until we’re on the plane about to take off",
    "I try to do this for early international flights and I am not that far from the airport. It is so much nicer.",
    "We always do this. Game changer. Share a bottle of wine, or whatever, and relax. Makes the next morning so much better.\nMake it part of your trip.",
    "I’m in the UK and we usually do this. We’re doing it next weekend when we go to Prague as we’re flying from Stansted and it’s a good 2.5 hour drive. Means leaving at around 1.30am. No thanks",
    "This is what I do with my family whenever possible.  It forces us to be packed and ready a day early and eliminates the morning frenzied rush out the door.  If you stay somewhere close enough, the hotel may have a “park and fly” service so you can leave your car there, avoid traffic, avoid excessive airport parking fees, and take a hotel shuttle right to the departure terminal.  They’ll pick you up when you get back and take you to your car, too.",
    "Her 730 is to be AT the airport not leave for the airport. They should be walking in no less than 3 hours before their flight",
    "I’d add - if you get through security with way too much time, see if you can buy a day pass at the lounge for whichever airline you’re flying. It will be much more calm and you can get a bite to eat",
    "As much as I hate to reduce a marital dispute like this to \"you're right, he's wrong,\" I used to fly out of that terminal a lot for business, and ... you're right. Especially with the current disruption with flights, but in the best of times LAX generally, and that terminal particularly, are a crap shoot, and with your travel time as a consideration planning to arrive 4 hours before your flight is the right move. \n\nBUT, **does your husband even really want to go on this trip**? At all? To a person with anxiety about planes, LAX to Japan would be nightmare fuel. You're in the air for 12 hours, likely in the plane for closer to 14. Add the time before the flight and the time to clear customs and get out of the airport on the other side, and that's 20 hours of hell. \n\nYou said you've done all the planning, because he is anxious, but are you sure that he's not trying to tell you something here? \n\nIt sounds like this trip is really important to you, but I strongly suggest that you sit down and talk with him, and make sure he's not just agreeing so as not to disappoint you.  I'm afraid you're setting you both up for a horrible situation when he finally loses it and can't get on the plane. Blessings on you both, whatever you decide. \n\nNAH",
    "yeah like... is he trying to miss this flight? At my airport, 2 hours is plenty of time, even for an international flight, and I've never flown through LAX but I'm pretty sure 2 hours would NOT be near enough time....",
    "I can definitely see a “oh NO, we missed the flight! Too bad so sad!” said with an enormous smile on his face in their future",
    "Im gonna hazard a guess he didnt pay for much",
    "I mean, they're married. So it's all \"their\" money. \"He\" is paying it all. So is \"she\".",
    "I’m married and our finances are almost entirely separate. We have separate credit cards, separate personal bank accounts, and one joint account we both move money into to pay joint bills like rent. Not every married couple lives by \"all money is our money\".",
    "Except it is marital property. Especially in a community property state.",
    "That will matter in the divorce, in the day to day if you pay out of your accounts YOU don't have that money for other things you want to buy.",
    "Hahaha is your airport Changi? Because same. \n\nSometimes I forget that the standard for other airports is closer to 3 hours and I’ve definitely had some close calls",
    "Changi is such a breeze, but at least there's plenty to see and do if you arrive too early.",
    "lol I used to LEAVE MY HOUSE like 1.5 hours before flying when I lived in SG, I was a monster 🤣 I was devastated when I moved to Jurong East and I needed to leave my house 2 hours before. Terrible",
    "Milwaukee airport is super fast too. I work right next to it and we have a lot of business travel at my company. People will  start packing up to head to the airport 30 minutes before their flight. \n\nI'm originally from Dallas and used to DFW, so this was a huge culture shock to me when I moved here lol.",
    "This is one of the nice things about living in a smaller city. Anytime I fly, the airport has little to no wait for security, the gates are all close by, and there's no hassle at all. You can only get direct flight to a handful of major cities, so you'll almost always have a connecting flight to deal with, but its still nice.",
    "JFK in NYC checking in, and yep, there’s no way in hell I’d risk only giving myself two hours before an international flight. Hell, flying from JFK to LAX (and the reverse), I usually give myself 90m to two hours. Sometimes you fly through security, and sometimes it takes all of that cushion time. With busy airports — ESPECIALLY at a convenient midmorning flight time — it’s way better to have the time and not need it, than to desperately need it and not have it.",
    "Man, this makes me super grateful for my international travel experiences; I've never gotten to SeaTac more than 2 hours before a flight and usually am through security in ten minutes. Feeling spoiled by our relatively non-busy PNW airports!",
    "I flight JFK  to San Diego once a month. I leave 4 hours before flight in NYC and 3 in San Diego. If you're bags aren't checked in on time you won't have them.",
    "He may want to go, but is just super dreading the flight.\n\nMy first flight was from Sac to San Diego (just an hour ish, lol), and while I really really wanted to go, my anxiety was so bad I could barely lift my feet to get on the plane, like my body was shutting down.\n\nLuckily for me, I ended up enjoying flying, but you never know until you try.\n\nBut I agree they should be there as early as possible.. On our return trip we had a stop at LAX and missed the connection by seconds and had to wait two hours for the next flight.",
    "Yeah agree. As someone with anxiety myself, I can completely understand his position. He likely doesnt want to do this long flight trip as his first international trip. Perhaps a shorter trip would have helped him get used to the idea of flying. But well 2 days till the flight…stock up on Dramamine, Valium whatever helps him. You do not want panic attack mid flight.",
    "People don't cancel trips when they miss flights. Airlines rebook them on the next flight with space.",
    "Alternatively, anxiety isn't logical and he may not have thought that far if that's genuinely his intention",
    "It also might not be a super conscious plan - just a general feeling of avoiding the moment as long as possible.",
    "At a cost though. It's not free, right?",
    "Coming from someone insanely comfortable flying and have flown planes myself (only turboprop). I've always said if I had to goto Japan, Australia, or anywhere in that area. I'm 100% going from the Virginia, to Kansas, to Cali/Washington, to Alaska, to Russia, then Japan/Australia. \n\nI'm fine in planes but sitting there for 14 fucking hours? I'd lose my mind.",
    "Conveniently Hawaii is almost at the halfway point between USA mainland and Australia (only a couple hours closer to the US). It’s the perfect pit stop for long haul between the two countries, especially if you can make it a couple days layover. I’ve done that a few times now.\n\nFiji is also a nice pit stop.",
    "I’ve done SFO to SYD trip 8 times in  the last 12 years and it’s as awful as you can imagine (unless of course you have $10k to go business)",
    "LAX is a mad house. Get to the airport 4 hours early, that's the earliest you can check in for your flight. If you both have anxiety medications I suggest you have them with you. Or a meditation app, calming music. Anything to help pass the time.",
    "This. My bf has huge anxiety about flying and their doctor prescribes Ativan for the trip.\n\nAnother person I know just takes NyQuil on the flight. \n\n4 hours early for LAX. Security lines, screening, traffic, weather, etc. \n\n4 hours early and Ativan for the flight.",
    "I took half an Ativan and a Benadryl on my flight from LAX to New Zealand and slept for just about the entire flight. Can definitely recommend.",
    "I'm taking an ativan tonight in honor of whoever reported your comment. And for civility of all things.",
    "And look up the business class lounge. It’s often $35 or so per person to use some of them. Maybe you can sit there in a calmer area if you do have time",
    "A lot of the good lounges are no longer accessible like that BUT lax does have a star alliance day pass lounge that will take ana passengers. Id get there the 4h early and eat breakfast and have a few mimosas. The Polaris lounge there, while phenomenal, isn't accessible. If OP has priority pass (sapphire benefit) they can access a few lounges for free. She should check her credit card perks and get some free drinks and food out of it",
    "NTA - airlines explicitly tell you to arrive *at least* three hours early for an international flight. If you’re flying in the next few days you absolutely need to get there 4 hours early because of the reasons you outlined. \n\n-Sincerely, an Angeleno who has never gotten to LAX in less than 45 minutes and I live in Hollywood, not 1.5 hrs away.",
    "Yeah, there’s nothing “selfish” about wanting to be cautious and responsible, and ensuring you don’t miss the trip you’ve carefully planned and paid for. \n\n3 hours is the standard for all international flights, even at smaller, less hectic airports. LAX is a madhouse. Add LA traffic and government shutdown / FAA shortage chaos to the mix, and it’s a recipe for disaster.\n\nYou aren’t being insensitive, OP. You’re being rational and responsible. \n\nI think the bigger issues here are (1) it doesn’t really sound like your husband even wants to take this trip, (2) it’s pretty lame he didn’t help with any of the planning and preparations, but then dares to call *you* selfish, and for what? Wanting to do something totally practical and logical, even though it isn’t what he wants? and (3) he seems to be weaponizing his anxiety against you, and making you out to be the bad guy for prioritizing reality and facts over his feelings. \n\nHe’s never even flown internationally before, and clearly has no idea what’s safe or reasonable (2 hours?? At LAX?), and he’s done none of the research, planning, or preparations for the trip, so of course he has no idea. Why isn’t he listening to you? What rational leg does he have to stand on? Why is he so convinced he’s right? Is coddling his anxiety really so much more important to him than ensuring you don’t miss your honeymoon? Now *that’s* what I’d call selfish. \n\nSorry, OP, but I’d be pissed in your position. From the little bit of context you’ve provided here, your husband doesn’t sound very mature, rational, helpful, or responsible.\n\nMaybe he should do some actual research on the subject instead of putting that on you and then blaming you for presenting realities he doesn’t like. And he could pick up some anxiety meds while he’s at it, too. He needs to pursue actual solutions instead of avoidance.",
    "Harsh reality check OP. Sorry to say, but this person is right on the money.",
    "Thank you for calling out the way he weaponized his anxiety.  If that’s a pattern then they really need to do some counseling together.",
    "Add on that it is RAINING here in LA for the next 5 days and we completely forget how to operate vehicles when drops of water fall.   Plus, our roads will be all churned up with potholes and repair closures/flood warnings, so please leave early, then you can sit and grab a breakfast burrito at Bread & Butter right outside of LAX.",
    "This this this.  Omg this.",
    "The first time I flew international out of LAX I got the near full TSA experience. They found “explosives” on my shoes. Had to go to their little screening rooms and everything. Pretty sure it was because it was two months before Fourth of July and my Ahole neighbors had a gigantic arsenal of illegal fireworks and were lighting off mortars over our house every single night leading up to the grand finale.\n\nAny way, best to leave as much time as possible. Especially with what’s going on these days. ",
    "I have a rule. If I don’t plan any of the trip then I roll with the trip planner’s agenda. You put in how many ridiculous hours of research? The man can roll into the airport two hours earlier than his preference. It’s already a tough airport then add it the lingering traffic controller chaos + customs? \n\nIf he continues to complain then tell him you’re going to be at the airport 4 hours early.  He can plan one tiny portion of his trip and decide how to get himself to the airport in his desired 2 hour window. \n\nNTA\n\nPS: Tell the man to get a prescription for an anti-anxiety. Not being mean, there’s just no reason for him to spend so much time having anxiety over having anxiety.",
    "NTA for the OP and also came to co-sign about the anxiety medication. I’m not a very good flyer at all and it’s just easier for me to take a Klonopin, prescribed by my doctor and relax and not be stressed out for however long the flight is. And sounds like this one’s a long one. Just talk to your doctor, mine didn’t even ask twice about it.",

I have a check list to make sure nothing is missed on my end and his philosophy is if it makes it and he needs it awesome if not it’s on him.  \n\nWhen I realized this was going to be a thing instead of fighting with him about it, since it was my anxiety we were dealing with, I made sure to have some of his basic needs packed in my carry on. If he’s packed them they’re duplicates. If he forgot or is separate from his luggage, win-win he has what he needs and I am the badass with foresight. \n\nThis came in clutch when on a trip to Mexico we had a two day layover in California to visit some family there and we got separated from our checked luggage.  My carryon will always have all of our essentials and some of our wants.  His if it’s brought will prob have these as well. (I don’t believe he had a carry on this trip or if he did it was gate checked) \n\nBecause I had my carry on he had multiple days of essentials and we only needed to get some colder weather gear (it was January and we were not planning for an extended time in cold weather) \n\nThere have been a couple times that he’s forgotten certain items he wanted but he’s very chill about it, and because I’m a contingency planner to the nth I had backups of the times he forgot.  \n\nRule in our house is: we can get separated or gate check anything of his but my carryon must always be with us because of how and what I pack.  \n\nHe also has a snack bag  he brings in a tote bag as his personal item because I rarely pack interim snacks.  And he will absolutely toss me a protein bar or a powder packet of electrolyte mixer to put in my water (I bring empty tumbler and fill it up at one of the coffee shops at the gate or wherever) if I’m looking like I need it or if we have an early flight coz I cannot eat super soon after I wake up. It makes me nauseated.   By the time I can eat or I’m hungry we are probably either on the plane or waiting to board.  I am not wild tho.  If I know it’ll be an early morning flight and I know the food places will be open I do grab something to bring on the plane but sometimes we leave around the time they’re opening and I’m not one to risk missing a flight when the inflight meal will be served within like an hour of takeoff.",

My partner had been in Munich for two weeks for work already. His work was done, so I was coming over. The week we had planned was for our **20th anniversary**.\n\nI had forgotten about the construction of a parking garage going on at the airport at the time. I’m also chronologically challenged and just left my house late.\n\nI seriously expected my man to end the relationship over this. To this day, I’m grateful he did not. I would not have blamed him had he decided he was done with me.\n\nOh… I arrived at the airport somewhere around 90 minutes before my flight. Even though this first leg was domestic, my overall flight was international, so I missed the cutoff. Things worked out, thankfully. I got on a later flight and arrived in Munich Friday evening instead of Friday morning. But there’s no reason for either of you to endure that kind of stress. I get that he has a fear of flying and hanging around the airport is not a happy fun time for him. But you don’t know what other delays might occur. Traffic, accident, or some of the security scanners are down so there’s a giant line for the TSA screening. Compromise, plan for 3 hours early, and see if you can gently encourage him to get out the door early on the day of the flight.\n\nCongratulations on your nuptials! I hope you have a wonderful and safe trip.",

    "It’s absolutely been a point of contention. And, yes, on this specific trip my partner stressed to me the importance of getting to the airport on time.\n\nHe actually handled the whole incident really well. Of course, it helped that he was busy with work so he couldn’t dwell on it. I had been rebooked when I called and told him, so I had taken care of the issue. It was just that I did the one thing he asked/told/warned me about.",
    "The amount of anxiety you'll both feel if you have to sprint to your gate will be worse than if you have to sit and wait for an extra hour.

But I may be biased as I like to arrive early for flights, I just went on an international flight and I was there 3 hours early and fortunately or unfortunately the line for TSA was like 20 minutes.  I just roamed the airport and then my phone until my flight. NAH",

Course that can be security anywhere but still. LAX used to be my base airport so I feel your pain.  3 hours should be fine. Plus the government shutdown is over (or it was reported to be over when I looked earlier so pardon me if I'm wrong).  \nAnyway, if he puts his foot down about longer than 2 hours, explain to him that if he thinks he's going to be anxious in the airport waiting, that's nothing compared to the anxiety that he'll feel if you guys are in a big security line and at risk of missing an international flight.

    "I won't even accept a layover less than 2 hours at LAX anymore because of how stressful that airport is. I have almost missed my flights there so many times, which is way more anxiety inducing than arriving with plenty of time and getting to take a break at the gate before boarding.",
    "What is his belief even based on? Pure wishful thinking? He has no experience with this sort of trip.

I usually just do my best to be patient and accommodate as much as reasonably possible. \n\nI was not okay with having planned it myself for a while until I voiced it to him and talked about how his anxiety was just really bad. He didn’t get more involved but I accepted I was in control of it. I guess I really wish we had managed the anxiety before today but didn’t really make a plan for that.",

Even 3 is dodgy. Traffic is so up in the air, especially in LA. \n\nI also find it strange that he’s more anxious about getting there early and having to wait around, rather than being anxious about missing the flight. Every time I’ve flown my anxiety has been about missing my flight. Are you sure he wants to go? Because his insistence on two hours sounds like he’s trying to make you miss your flight.

There’s no reason for him to be in this much distress. Plus, it’s making him unpleasant and unhelpful.",
    "No no no, 3 hours is not reasonable right now. TSA is taking hours. LAX is massive. There is no compromise. You will need at least 3 hours to get through TSA and another 20-30 minutes to walk to your gate. Don’t let people con you into ignoring our current reality. Your husband needs to learn how to actually manage his anxiety, not expect you to play pretend so he feels better.",
    "I have worked in aviation since 1987. Get there at least 4 hours before! Also: I caution against Xanax, valium, etc. It often has a more pronounced effect at altitude, makes the person sick/woozy/feel awful, and results in medical attention. \n\nEat before you go to the airport, bring snacks, and STAY HYDRATED! Dehydration results in more sick passengers than anything else. \n\nSafe travels and happy honeymooning!",
    "Nta. He wants to give himself less time to get things done because that’s chill? His reasoning doesn’t make sense honestly…I think 3 hours is fine, and a suitable compromise…but 4 hours is more than enough time to get some food and chill before boarding.",
    "I would suggest aiming for 8 am for arrival at LAX, especially if you're flying out of the Bradley terminal. Traffic on the 405 is ALWAYS a nightmare in the morning in both directions. You can have some breakfast in the terminal and have time to relax before boarding. This way it will take some stress off you if you're running late due to traffic and some stress off of him if you get there closer to 8:30 am.",
    "NTA:\n\nIn a nutshell, if he respects your feelings, he'd put up with it just so you can feel better about it.\n\nIf your flight leaves at 11:30, it's likely boarding around 10:30-10:45. That's the time I want to be at the gate.\n\nDepending on the airline being there extra early can mean waiting forever in the Bradley Terminal ticketing area (for foreign carriers, and not a pleasant experience) because they do not process check-in or luggage until 3 hours or so prior to boarding. If flying out on a domestic airline (like United) you can check in early and \"enjoy\" the terminal and all it has to offer.\n\nMost of the delay reasons you mention will just make your flight depart later, except for any TSA staffing issues which will delay YOU.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, there can be alternatives to driving to the airport and racking up huge parking fees.  In the SFV, you have the Flyaway in Van Nuys that leaves every 30 minutes for LAX, and parking is cheap there.  There's also one at Union Station - but I don't use that one and don't know about the parking. Taking that bus doesn't take any longer and you don't have to put up with the traffic - they do.",
    "Could you get a hotel room the night before?",
    "You could leave your house with enough time to get you there 4 hours early, and if everything goes well on the way there, stop somewhere close by to grab a drink (coffee, etc) or a meal. That gets you close enough to be there at least 2 hours early, but you're not hanging out in the terminal. 4 hours in the terminal is enough to make anyone go batty.\nAnd have fun on your trip, I loved traveling in Japan!",
    "Getting there four hours early doesn't mean hanging out ~~in~~ at the ~~terminal~~ gate for four hours. If you're *lucky* it'll take a full hour to drop luggage and get through TSA, and then because LAX is so big it could easily take you fifteen minutes just to get to the ~~terminal~~ gate from there. Depending on the day, it could take much longer to get through baggage check and TSA. And this is not considering government shutdowns and recent FAA stuff...\n\nI would plan to be walking into the airport at least three hours before boarding closes. You never know if you're going to choose the wrong line, get backed up by a huge procession of people who don't have experience getting through security, or suddenly have to repack your luggage because something that should be in your carry-on is in your checked bag.\n\nTwo hours isn't enough time if something unexpected happens, and last-minute, re-booked flights to Japan are not cheap. Three hours should be enough time to get to where you need to be with time to spare and grab a coffee or browse the \\*shops near the ~~terminal~~ gate if you're bored.\n\nEdit: Mixed up terminal and gate. Showed my butt... Sorry to the person I'm responding to, I feel silly!",
    "NAH, I don't think arguing about what time to arrive at the airport really makes anyone an asshole.\n\nI have a lot of experience with airports and a decent amount with intercontinental travel and I would say the following: 4 hours seems excessive, 2 hours seems dicey, I would compromise on 3 to 3.5. And then assuage his anxiety by buying passes to your airline's lounge. Costs somewhere in the $60-80 range and it's not super 5-star luxury, but it's perfectly pleasant to hang out in, and beats chilling at the gate for 2.5 hours by a mile. Just consider it to be the start of your vacation, I promise you it's money well spent in this situation.",

American is even worse at T4, just after TBIT. \n\nHow are you getting to LAX?  Flyaway stops at every terminal, park n ride shuttles stop based on need, rideshares go directly to your terminal but at times it’s taken us 45 minutes to get to TBIT in our car. There are no shortcuts to TBIT or T4 as there are to most other terminals.  Luckily for us we were picking up that night but if we were flying out we would have bailed out of our transportation and walked. \n\nChecking in luggage takes time as it has to be done at the counter. \n\nThere’s a reason they say to get to the airport at least 3 hours early.",

You know this, he will figure it out, too.",
    "Traffic getting to the airport is actually what I’m most anxious about. But also the unknown wait times for tsa. I have almost missed my flights in the past for both of these reasons.",
    "The less time you give yourself, the more hectic and stressful EVERYTHING will be. \n\nGet a hotel nearby. Sleep by the airport the night before. Get up around 6:30-7, have breakfast there (or find a nice little cafe place you can visit once inside the terminal) and give yourself AMPLE time so you guys don’t have the time crunch pressuring you. Go for 4 hours early, but without the drive. \n\nEither the hotel will do long term parking, or you drive to your parking area in the morning.

    "in addition to what everyone else has mentioned, I would try to plan a calm discussion around this kind of rigidity and refusal. If it were anything else, I’m sure compromises could be made. But an international trip to somewhere like Japan is objectively pricey and I think the stress of potentially missing your flights because he couldn’t find ways to try to meet you somewhere in the middle would make me feel concerned for feelings of resentment and other potential future issues y’all might run into that just happen in life/marriage. He’s an adult, if he really didn’t want to go on this trip, that should’ve been thoroughly discussed when you brought up where you wanted to go, and he had all of this time to prep for it for the sake of having a good honeymoon. \n\nI can’t say I understand flight anxiety, but I do know I always try to do my best in making compromises for my partner simply because I love them.",

You live 1.5 hours away from the airport, which means there are going to be many opportunities for getting stuck in traffic.**\n\n>*It seems his anxiety would be much worse if traffic delays make you have to rush to get through TSA checks and to get to your gate. I have TSA Precheck AND Global Entry. I’m also high status with my preferred airline and in your scenario, I wouldn’t even risk it. Is coddling his anxiety worth missing both your dream trips.*\n\n**Make a reservation at one of the airport hotels that provide shuttle service to the airport.

    "Two hours is too risky. You need to be at the gate about 45 minutes before departure. You also need to allow an hour to get through security before that. Airports are big. It could take you 15 minutes to get from security to your gate. Depending on the check in system, checking in could easily take 30 minutes. For long haul flights you should always get to the airport three hours before departure.\n\nAsk your husband what risking missing his flight would do for his anxiety. Remind him that the most risky part of the journey is travelling to the airport. Flying really is the safest form of transport.",
    "They literally tell you to be there 3 hours before an international flight. My sister just flew out of LAX and that was the instruction. With rain, definitely plan a little leeway.

At all? To a person with anxiety about planes, LAX to Japan would be nightmare fuel. You're in the air for 12 hours, likely in the plane for closer to 14. Add the time before the flight and the time to clear customs and get out of the airport on the other side, and that's 20 hours of hell. \n\nYou said you've done all the planning, because he is anxious, but are you sure that he's not trying to tell you something here? \n\nIt sounds like this trip is really important to you, but I strongly suggest that you sit down and talk with him, and make sure he's not just agreeing so as not to disappoint you.

You’re being rational and responsible. \n\nI think the bigger issues here are (1) it doesn’t really sound like your husband even wants to take this trip, (2) it’s pretty lame he didn’t help with any of the planning and preparations, but then dares to call *you* selfish, and for what? Wanting to do something totally practical and logical, even though it isn’t what he wants? and (3) he seems to be weaponizing his anxiety against you, and making you out to be the bad guy for prioritizing reality and facts over his feelings. \n\nHe’s never even flown internationally before, and clearly has no idea what’s safe or reasonable (2 hours?? At LAX?), and he’s done none of the research, planning, or preparations for the trip, so of course he has no idea. Why isn’t he listening to you? What rational leg does he have to stand on? Why is he so convinced he’s right? Is coddling his anxiety really so much more important to him than ensuring you don’t miss your honeymoon? Now *that’s* what I’d call selfish. \n\nSorry, OP, but I’d be pissed in your position. From the little bit of context you’ve provided here, your husband doesn’t sound very mature, rational, helpful, or responsible.\n\nMaybe he should do some actual research on the subject instead of putting that on you and then blaming you for presenting realities he doesn’t like. And he could pick up some anxiety meds while he’s at it, too. He needs to pursue actual solutions instead of avoidance.",

I have a check list to make sure nothing is missed on my end and his philosophy is if it makes it and he needs it awesome if not it’s on him.  \n\nWhen I realized this was going to be a thing instead of fighting with him about it, since it was my anxiety we were dealing with, I made sure to have some of his basic needs packed in my carry on. If he’s packed them they’re duplicates. If he forgot or is separate from his luggage, win-win he has what he needs and I am the badass with foresight. \n\nThis came in clutch when on a trip to Mexico we had a two day layover in California to visit some family there and we got separated from our checked luggage.  My carryon will always have all of our essentials and some of our wants.  His if it’s brought will prob have these as well. (I don’t believe he had a carry on this trip or if he did it was gate checked) \n\nBecause I had my carry on he had multiple days of essentials and we only needed to get some colder weather gear (it was January and we were not planning for an extended time in cold weather) \n\nThere have been a couple times that he’s forgotten certain items he wanted but he’s very chill about it, and because I’m a contingency planner to the nth I had backups of the times he forgot.  \n\nRule in our house is: we can get separated or gate check anything of his but my carryon must always be with us because of how and what I pack.  \n\nHe also has a snack bag  he brings in a tote bag as his personal item because I rarely pack interim snacks.  And he will absolutely toss me a protein bar or a powder packet of electrolyte mixer to put in my water (I bring empty tumbler and fill it up at one of the coffee shops at the gate or wherever) if I’m looking like I need it or if we have an early flight coz I cannot eat super soon after I wake up. It makes me nauseated.   By the time I can eat or I’m hungry we are probably either on the plane or waiting to board.  I am not wild tho.  If I know it’ll be an early morning flight and I know the food places will be open I do grab something to bring on the plane but sometimes we leave around the time they’re opening and I’m not one to risk missing a flight when the inflight meal will be served within like an hour of takeoff.",

        "text": "NTA\n\nYou wanna know what broke me of getting to an airport the minimum suggested time (or less) before a flight?\n\nMissing the first leg of my first international flight to Germany (flight from Austin to… somewhere here in the US). My partner had been in Munich for two weeks for work already. His work was done, so I was coming over. The week we had planned was for our **20th anniversary**.\n\nI had forgotten about the construction of a parking garage going on at the airport at the time. I’m also chronologically challenged and just left my house late.\n\nI seriously expected my man to end the relationship over this. To this day, I’m grateful he did not. I would not have blamed him had he decided he was done with me.\n\nOh… I arrived at the airport somewhere around 90 minutes before my flight. Even though this first leg was domestic, my overall flight was international, so I missed the cutoff. Things worked out, thankfully. I got on a later flight and arrived in Munich Friday evening instead of Friday morning. But there’s no reason for either of you to endure that kind of stress. I get that he has a fear of flying and hanging around the airport is not a happy fun time for him. But you don’t know what other delays might occur. Traffic, accident, or some of the security scanners are down so there’s a giant line for the TSA screening. Compromise, plan for 3 hours early, and see if you can gently encourage him to get out the door early on the day of the flight.\n\nCongratulations on your nuptials! I hope you have a wonderful and safe trip.",

That's the time I want to be at the gate.\n\nDepending on the airline being there extra early can mean waiting forever in the Bradley Terminal ticketing area (for foreign carriers, and not a pleasant experience) because they do not process check-in or luggage until 3 hours or so prior to boarding. If flying out on a domestic airline (like United) you can check in early and \"enjoy\" the terminal and all it has to offer.\n\nMost of the delay reasons you mention will just make your flight depart later, except for any TSA staffing issues which will delay YOU.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, there can be alternatives to driving to the airport and racking up huge parking fees.  In the SFV, you have the Flyaway in Van Nuys that leaves every 30 minutes for LAX, and parking is cheap there.  There's also one at Union Station - but I don't use that one and don't know about the parking. Taking that bus doesn't take any longer and you don't have to put up with the traffic - they do.",

You’re being rational and responsible. \n\nI think the bigger issues here are (1) it doesn’t really sound like your husband even wants to take this trip, (2) it’s pretty lame he didn’t help with any of the planning and preparations, but then dares to call *you* selfish, and for what? Wanting to do something totally practical and logical, even though it isn’t what he wants? and (3) he seems to be weaponizing his anxiety against you, and making you out to be the bad guy for prioritizing reality and facts over his feelings. \n\nHe’s never even flown internationally before, and clearly has no idea what’s safe or reasonable (2 hours?? At LAX?), and he’s done none of the research, planning, or preparations for the trip, so of course he has no idea. Why isn’t he listening to you? What rational leg does he have to stand on? Why is he so convinced he’s right? Is coddling his anxiety really so much more important to him than ensuring you don’t miss your honeymoon? Now *that’s* what I’d call selfish. \n\nSorry, OP, but I’d be pissed in your position. From the little bit of context you’ve provided here, your husband doesn’t sound very mature, rational, helpful, or responsible.\n\nMaybe he should do some actual research on the subject instead of putting that on you and then blaming you for presenting realities he doesn’t like.

I have a check list to make sure nothing is missed on my end and his philosophy is if it makes it and he needs it awesome if not it’s on him.  \n\nWhen I realized this was going to be a thing instead of fighting with him about it, since it was my anxiety we were dealing with, I made sure to have some of his basic needs packed in my carry on. If he’s packed them they’re duplicates. If he forgot or is separate from his luggage, win-win he has what he needs and I am the badass with foresight. \n\nThis came in clutch when on a trip to Mexico we had a two day layover in California to visit some family there and we got separated from our checked luggage.  My carryon will always have all of our essentials and some of our wants.  His if it’s brought will prob have these as well. (I don’t believe he had a carry on this trip or if he did it was gate checked) \n\nBecause I had my carry on he had multiple days of essentials and we only needed to get some colder weather gear (it was January and we were not planning for an extended time in cold weather) \n\nThere have been a couple times that he’s forgotten certain items he wanted but he’s very chill about it, and because I’m a contingency planner to the nth I had backups of the times he forgot.  \n\nRule in our house is: we can get separated or gate check anything of his but my carryon must always be with us because of how and what I pack.  \n\nHe also has a snack bag  he brings in a tote bag as his personal item because I rarely pack interim snacks.  And he will absolutely toss me a protein bar or a powder packet of electrolyte mixer to put in my water (I bring empty tumbler and fill it up at one of the coffee shops at the gate or wherever) if I’m looking like I need it or if we have an early flight coz I cannot eat super soon after I wake up. It makes me nauseated.   By the time I can eat or I’m hungry we are probably either on the plane or waiting to board.  I am not wild tho.  If I know it’ll be an early morning flight and I know the food places will be open I do grab something to bring on the plane but sometimes we leave around the time they’re opening and I’m not one to risk missing a flight when the inflight meal will be served within like an hour of takeoff.",

My partner had been in Munich for two weeks for work already. His work was done, so I was coming over. The week we had planned was for our **20th anniversary**.\n\nI had forgotten about the construction of a parking garage going on at the airport at the time. I’m also chronologically challenged and just left my house late.\n\nI seriously expected my man to end the relationship over this. To this day, I’m grateful he did not. I would not have blamed him had he decided he was done with me.\n\nOh… I arrived at the airport somewhere around 90 minutes before my flight. Even though this first leg was domestic, my overall flight was international, so I missed the cutoff. Things worked out, thankfully. I got on a later flight and arrived in Munich Friday evening instead of Friday morning. But there’s no reason for either of you to endure that kind of stress. I get that he has a fear of flying and hanging around the airport is not a happy fun time for him. But you don’t know what other delays might occur. Traffic, accident, or some of the security scanners are down so there’s a giant line for the TSA screening. Compromise, plan for 3 hours early, and see if you can gently encourage him to get out the door early on the day of the flight.\n\nCongratulations on your nuptials!

That's the time I want to be at the gate.\n\nDepending on the airline being there extra early can mean waiting forever in the Bradley Terminal ticketing area (for foreign carriers, and not a pleasant experience) because they do not process check-in or luggage until 3 hours or so prior to boarding. If flying out on a domestic airline (like United) you can check in early and \"enjoy\" the terminal and all it has to offer.\n\nMost of the delay reasons you mention will just make your flight depart later, except for any TSA staffing issues which will delay YOU.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, there can be alternatives to driving to the airport and racking up huge parking fees.  In the SFV, you have the Flyaway in Van Nuys that leaves every 30 minutes for LAX, and parking is cheap there.  There's also one at Union Station - but I don't use that one and don't know about the parking. Taking that bus doesn't take any longer and you don't have to put up with the traffic - they do.",

If it were anything else, I’m sure compromises could be made. But an international trip to somewhere like Japan is objectively pricey and I think the stress of potentially missing your flights because he couldn’t find ways to try to meet you somewhere in the middle would make me feel concerned for feelings of resentment and other potential future issues y’all might run into that just happen in life/marriage. He’s an adult, if he really didn’t want to go on this trip, that should’ve been thoroughly discussed when you brought up where you wanted to go, and he had all of this time to prep for it for the sake of having a good honeymoon. \n\nI can’t say I understand flight anxiety, but I do know I always try to do my best in making compromises for my partner simply because I love them.",
