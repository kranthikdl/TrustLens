I'm not living under whatever \"anything\" is in these peoples eyes, especially if it comes from the minds of some of the most evilest people on the planet.

They have been for well over a decade.  Russia having nukes should not paralyze it's declared opponents from acting appropriately in response to its provocations.  To let them do so is to take a gamble that they won't abuse said inaction, to continuously weaken Europe and NATO, in ways that will inevitably result in direct, potentially-nuclear, conflict, anyway(which, by all indications, is exactly what they will do in the future/what they are working towards, no matter what happens).  Yes, to respond now strongly is also a gamble.  When everything is a gamble, the potential success rate of their nuclear capabilities DOES matter.  It does figure into the equation since the threat is already there and imminent.  Gambling on possibilities is all we have.  Every action or inaction NATO can take, it's damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Long-term, short-term, this is all going to come home to roost.  Knowing, or even having an approximation of, just how faulty Russia's nuclear efficacy is **absolutely** important to the conversation.  Stop pretending it's not.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Your mistake is believing that \"not crossing lines\" is without risk as concerns potential future nuclear war.  BOTH crossing lines and not crossing lines are risky in this regard.  The variables that feed into the level of risks, in either case, matter.  We are not in a situation of certainty in either case.  And whether Russia's nuclear arsenal is potentially effective or not certainly feed into that evaluation of risk.\n\n\nEdit:  Adjusted for clarity.",

They have been for well over a decade.  Russia having nukes should not paralyze it's declared opponents from acting appropriately in response to its provocations.  To let them do so is to take a gamble that they won't abuse said inaction, to continuously weaken Europe and NATO, in ways that will inevitably result in direct, potentially-nuclear, conflict, anyway(which, by all indications, is exactly what they will do in the future/what they are working towards, no matter what happens).  Yes, to respond now strongly is also a gamble.  When everything is a gamble, the potential success rate of their nuclear capabilities DOES matter.  It does figure into the equation since the threat is already there and imminent.  Gambling on possibilities is all we have.  Every action or inaction NATO can take, it's damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Long-term, short-term, this is all going to come home to roost.  Knowing, or even having an approximation of, just how faulty Russia's nuclear efficacy is **absolutely** important to the conversation.  Stop pretending it's not.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Your mistake is believing that \"not crossing lines\" is without risk as concerns potential future nuclear war.  BOTH crossing lines and not crossing lines are risky in this regard.  The variables that feed into the level of risks, in either case, matter.  We are not in a situation of certainty in either case.  And whether Russia's nuclear arsenal is potentially effective or not certainly feed into that evaluation of risk.\n\n\nEdit:  Adjusted for clarity.",

        "text": "It's not so direct a thing.  Russia is already crossing all lines that SHOULD warrant stronger response from NATO countries than it is receiving.  They have been for well over a decade.  Russia having nukes should not paralyze it's declared opponents from acting appropriately in response to its provocations.  To let them do so is to take a gamble that they won't abuse said inaction, to continuously weaken Europe and NATO, in ways that will inevitably result in direct, potentially-nuclear, conflict, anyway(which, by all indications, is exactly what they will do in the future/what they are working towards, no matter what happens).  Yes, to respond now strongly is also a gamble.  When everything is a gamble, the potential success rate of their nuclear capabilities DOES matter.  It does figure into the equation since the threat is already there and imminent.  Gambling on possibilities is all we have.  Every action or inaction NATO can take, it's damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Long-term, short-term, this is all going to come home to roost.  Knowing, or even having an approximation of, just how faulty Russia's nuclear efficacy is **absolutely** important to the conversation.  Stop pretending it's not.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Your mistake is believing that \"not crossing lines\" is without risk as concerns potential future nuclear war.  BOTH crossing lines and not crossing lines are risky in this regard.  The variables that feed into the level of risks, in either case, matter.  We are not in a situation of certainty in either case.  And whether Russia's nuclear arsenal is potentially effective or not certainly feed into that evaluation of risk.\n\n\nEdit:  Adjusted for clarity.",
