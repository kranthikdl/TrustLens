I don’t think I’ve ever teamed up and then been betrayed at extract. It’s usually been the opposite. I remember calling the train while I was knocked by arc and someone found me and bandaged me up so I wouldn’t bleed out before the train got there. \n\n99% of the time I’m friendly with Raiders while playing solos. If I’m in trios then I feel I have to be more aggressive.",

Granted they werent night raids, but we did quite a few runs, and only two instances of peeps attacking us...\n\n\nThe other games, we ended up teaming with a couple other teams, and when you're 9 players strong, the arc melt like butter, well most of them. It was crazy fun. And to top off the night, on our last run, we randomly came upon a guy just playing his flute, with an audience dancing around him, couldn't even count how many... 🤣 one guy just playing a few crouched, some emote dancing, and everyone just being chill... Then about 10, 15, maybe more of us, extracted together as there wasn't much time left. \n\nThis game is just too good!",

On console, players are coming from COD, where you use your mic to talk shit, if at all.\n\nI haven’t played it in a while, but it’s easy to see on games like Rivals. Playing on PC, teammates are talking most games. They talk shit a lot, but they’re genuinely using their mics.

I just hope it doesn’t result in people turning crossplay off on PC based on some made up bullshit. \n\nAnd when you turn crossplay off on console, of course you’re going to run into more sweats, because it’s on by default, and casuals are never going to even know turning it off was an option. And those who turn it off want to make sure they never have to be in a lobby with kb/m players, because they just want to fight other raiders. \n\nThe difference in lobbies on ps5 (without crossplay) and crossplay lobbies has *WAY* more to do with the “crossplay off” setting itself than it does with the platform.",

I feel zero superiority and play with mostly console friends, I just wanted a better experience and some pc only games. It’s only certain weirdos online who care about the “pc master race”. Most people I know with computers don’t try and degrade console players. I keep crossplay on and have thoroughly enjoyed how friendly everyone is. Gaming is meant for personal enjoyment, there is enough fighting and comparison in real life.",

For me in Europe (way too close to Russia), over half of players I meet are Russian, and 90% of those are pure unfriendly and unsocial bastards who will either shoot you on sight, or berate you and then shoot. On the other hand (cardinal direction of the world), I get a lot of French, who also are pretty unfriendly and usually either SoS or betray you once they've healed up/you're occupied by ARCs.\n\nThe most friendly, for me, were Spanish people (I think, judging by their names and the way they spoke, might be wrong on that).\n\nGermans and British people were a coin toss, but they at least (mostly) responded on VoIP with: \"nah, I shoot people\".\n\nI'm on PC with cross play ON. I mostly get PC users so I can check their profiles on Steam, but if I stumble upon a console player, unless they spoke, I can't tell where they're from.",

It would be fascinating to know what the root cause is but I guess it's especially difficult to study currently, and nothing that reflects poorly on Russian social policy is likely to get published by researchers inside Russia.\n\n>Still amazes me that Russians are allowed on steam or in general mix with the European playerbases.\n\nI believe the general consensus on this is that most nations are not enforcing this as it cuts them off from information about the wider world, and businesses are unlikely to voluntarily cut off any large nation from their platforms. Valve could sequester them but that sets a bad precedent and would likely be circumvented anyway.",

      "text": "PVP focused games were always the most popular ones in Russia. When i was younger, i remember playing Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source on pirated servers, those were always filled, like 24/7 full. MMO games like Lineage or anything with open-pvp are legendary here, and often missed by older gaming population.  \n  \nNowadays, it's very normal for teens/young adults to play exclusively games like CS or Dota, maybe Valorant, R6 Siege or LoL. I don't know what's the deal with PVP games being that popular even now for sure, but i think a lot of folks don't really see gaming as something more than a simple hobby, hence why they stick to popular games with some competitive elements in it, so they can hop on and get some PVP out of it. It doesn't bother them whether they betray or get betrayed, whether there's \"honour\" in PVP or anything like that, they just go for fights and if they win they win, if they lose they lose. That's generalisation of course, we all know these loud Russian kids or even older folks who start unloading the whole swear vocabulary at you once they die lol, but from my anecdotal experience, a lot of Russian friends or just random people i met in games similar to Arc Raiders or Tarkov only really want to fight for the best loot and automatically see anyone as danger because they don't want to bother engaging with the whole anxiety-filled distrust thing.  \n\n\nMy guess for the root cause of how Russians behave in PVP games is simple - i think it's because gaming became mainstream with early versions of Counter-Strike or any old free pvp MMO, like way back in 2000s, when more and more people would get internet and see what it's like to fight for resources or just compete with other players. A lot of it was in \"local internet\" too, i don't know the term for it, but i remember having internet for just my city, we had our local websites, torrent trackers, videogame places, dedicated websites for specific games. When more and more people actually started to get into world-wide internet, they brought this merciless, PVP-focused culture with them, and it went into the mainstream Russian gaming culture.",

If you went around blowing up people's cars you'd be put in a bad sport lobby. Then the people who'd been put in a bad sport lobby would go on the subreddit crying about how awful bad sport lobbies were.\n\n\n Additionally I've never shot on sight, I've played 60 hours and always been peaceful unless the other person was the aggressor.\n\n\nI'll go through days in a row of peaceful lobbies.

I hardly ever team up but I do help people if they are being attacked by arc. I’ve defib when I can, I’ve dropped blueprints or loot if someone is in need. \n\nThe other day on the new map there were 6 of us looting in the same area and we all decided  to go kill the bastion.

It was crazy fun. And to top off the night, on our last run, we randomly came upon a guy just playing his flute, with an audience dancing around him, couldn't even count how many... 🤣 one guy just playing a few crouched, some emote dancing, and everyone just being chill... Then about 10, 15, maybe more of us, extracted together as there wasn't much time left. \n\nThis game is just too good!",

On console, players are coming from COD, where you use your mic to talk shit, if at all.\n\nI haven’t played it in a while, but it’s easy to see on games like Rivals.

I just hope it doesn’t result in people turning crossplay off on PC based on some made up bullshit. \n\nAnd when you turn crossplay off on console, of course you’re going to run into more sweats, because it’s on by default, and casuals are never going to even know turning it off was an option. And those who turn it off want to make sure they never have to be in a lobby with kb/m players, because they just want to fight other raiders. \n\nThe difference in lobbies on ps5 (without crossplay) and crossplay lobbies has *WAY* more to do with the “crossplay off” setting itself than it does with the platform.",

It would be fascinating to know what the root cause is but I guess it's especially difficult to study currently, and nothing that reflects poorly on Russian social policy is likely to get published by researchers inside Russia.\n\n>Still amazes me that Russians are allowed on steam or in general mix with the European playerbases.\n\nI believe the general consensus on this is that most nations are not enforcing this as it cuts them off from information about the wider world, and businesses are unlikely to voluntarily cut off any large nation from their platforms. Valve could sequester them but that sets a bad precedent and would likely be circumvented anyway.",

          "text": "PVP focused games were always the most popular ones in Russia. When i was younger, i remember playing Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source on pirated servers, those were always filled, like 24/7 full. MMO games like Lineage or anything with open-pvp are legendary here, and often missed by older gaming population.  \n  \nNowadays, it's very normal for teens/young adults to play exclusively games like CS or Dota, maybe Valorant, R6 Siege or LoL. I don't know what's the deal with PVP games being that popular even now for sure, but i think a lot of folks don't really see gaming as something more than a simple hobby, hence why they stick to popular games with some competitive elements in it, so they can hop on and get some PVP out of it. It doesn't bother them whether they betray or get betrayed, whether there's \"honour\" in PVP or anything like that, they just go for fights and if they win they win, if they lose they lose. That's generalisation of course, we all know these loud Russian kids or even older folks who start unloading the whole swear vocabulary at you once they die lol, but from my anecdotal experience, a lot of Russian friends or just random people i met in games similar to Arc Raiders or Tarkov only really want to fight for the best loot and automatically see anyone as danger because they don't want to bother engaging with the whole anxiety-filled distrust thing.  \n\n\nMy guess for the root cause of how Russians behave in PVP games is simple - i think it's because gaming became mainstream with early versions of Counter-Strike or any old free pvp MMO, like way back in 2000s, when more and more people would get internet and see what it's like to fight for resources or just compete with other players. A lot of it was in \"local internet\" too, i don't know the term for it, but i remember having internet for just my city, we had our local websites, torrent trackers, videogame places, dedicated websites for specific games. When more and more people actually started to get into world-wide internet, they brought this merciless, PVP-focused culture with them, and it went into the mainstream Russian gaming culture.",

On console, players are coming from COD, where you use your mic to talk shit, if at all.\n\nI haven’t played it in a while, but it’s easy to see on games like Rivals. Playing on PC, teammates are talking most games. They talk shit a lot, but they’re genuinely using their mics.

I’ve encountered maybe 5-10 players that have done this in my entire time playing this game (lvl 38).  \n\nAnd why would that guy continue to trust people and turn his back if he was getting betrayed that often? 50 bucks says OP is trying to prove a point by pulling made up stats out of his ass based on a handful of his own experiences. I just hope it doesn’t result in people turning crossplay off on PC based on some made up bullshit. \n\nAnd when you turn crossplay off on console, of course you’re going to run into more sweats, because it’s on by default, and casuals are never going to even know turning it off was an option. And those who turn it off want to make sure they never have to be in a lobby with kb/m players, because they just want to fight other raiders. \n\nThe difference in lobbies on ps5 (without crossplay) and crossplay lobbies has *WAY* more to do with the “crossplay off” setting itself than it does with the platform.",

For me in Europe (way too close to Russia), over half of players I meet are Russian, and 90% of those are pure unfriendly and unsocial bastards who will either shoot you on sight, or berate you and then shoot. On the other hand (cardinal direction of the world), I get a lot of French, who also are pretty unfriendly and usually either SoS or betray you once they've healed up/you're occupied by ARCs.\n\nThe most friendly, for me, were Spanish people (I think, judging by their names and the way they spoke, might be wrong on that).\n\nGermans and British people were a coin toss, but they at least (mostly) responded on VoIP with: \"nah, I shoot people\".\n\nI'm on PC with cross play ON. I mostly get PC users so I can check their profiles on Steam, but if I stumble upon a console player, unless they spoke, I can't tell where they're from.",

        "text": "PVP focused games were always the most popular ones in Russia. When i was younger, i remember playing Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source on pirated servers, those were always filled, like 24/7 full. MMO games like Lineage or anything with open-pvp are legendary here, and often missed by older gaming population.  \n  \nNowadays, it's very normal for teens/young adults to play exclusively games like CS or Dota, maybe Valorant, R6 Siege or LoL. I don't know what's the deal with PVP games being that popular even now for sure, but i think a lot of folks don't really see gaming as something more than a simple hobby, hence why they stick to popular games with some competitive elements in it, so they can hop on and get some PVP out of it. It doesn't bother them whether they betray or get betrayed, whether there's \"honour\" in PVP or anything like that, they just go for fights and if they win they win, if they lose they lose. That's generalisation of course, we all know these loud Russian kids or even older folks who start unloading the whole swear vocabulary at you once they die lol, but from my anecdotal experience, a lot of Russian friends or just random people i met in games similar to Arc Raiders or Tarkov only really want to fight for the best loot and automatically see anyone as danger because they don't want to bother engaging with the whole anxiety-filled distrust thing.  \n\n\nMy guess for the root cause of how Russians behave in PVP games is simple - i think it's because gaming became mainstream with early versions of Counter-Strike or any old free pvp MMO, like way back in 2000s, when more and more people would get internet and see what it's like to fight for resources or just compete with other players. A lot of it was in \"local internet\" too, i don't know the term for it, but i remember having internet for just my city, we had our local websites, torrent trackers, videogame places, dedicated websites for specific games. When more and more people actually started to get into world-wide internet, they brought this merciless, PVP-focused culture with them, and it went into the mainstream Russian gaming culture.",

I’ve died way more to spawning pops or other Arcs.\n\nAnd if this algorithmic matchmaking is true, the reason why people make the posts that say “oh no the game is sweaty now!” Is just Embark putting those people in lobbies that ARE sweatier to test and gauge their reaction.
