Cutting spending over increases over the last two years is clearly an attempt to pull the wool over Alaskan's eyes.
In NANA's downgrade, Moody's gives us their rationale which is liquidity driven; discourage borrowing; discourage debt. The three credit agency's have down graded our credit worthiness out of concern over spending and fiscal discipline.

"If you wanted a MLB stadium at that site, that ship sailed a couple of decades ago (or are there people who still think that Portland being used as a ""competitive bid"" to sweeten the deal for Montreal's move to Washington was actually a real opportunity? Please.).  While there was a strange plan to retrofit the stadium for baseball only (was never going to be multi use, it would have been terrible for soccer or football and WAS terrible for soccer before this renovation).

If we ever get a baseball team, a new stadium which was purpose built for baseball would be most appropriate, not a rectangular sports field which just wasn't finished on one side for 80 years.  Multipurpose stadiums just meant they were terrible for everyone and for that reason we stopped building them in the 60s.","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"

"Rome wasn't the largest power - it was about half the size of the Chinese empire. Second, Rome was a Middle Eastern Empire, not a European one (9 out of its 10 largest cities were in Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon and Syria). 

The reason Rome was smaller than India and China was that it had a lower population. The Indus river valley and Yangtze River valley are more fertile, and support much higher populations than Rome's biggest river valley at the Nile.

Rome's mortal enemy was the Parthian Empire. They both defeated each other several times. But neither of them could completely destroy the other. The Parthian Empire was also a second level world empire.","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"
"Nowhere in the NT will you find that Jesus or His apostles attempted any social reforms.  The did not protest slavery, or any other societal ""injustice.""  They preached the gospel, which, if accepted, creates its own social reform.

This effort, while maybe well-intentioned, is one of those ""bypath meadows"" which distracts us from our main goal:  preaching the 3 angels' messages.","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"

"I am so proud of this couple! To go through something as tragic as losing a child and turn it around to make sure that it doesnât happen to another family.  I know SIDS has been around for years but I donât think mothers or families are informed about this as they should be.  Thank you for the fundraising for the Owlet Baby Monitor, to keep this from happening to new mothers and families.  Leah and Robert you are making a difference after such a tragic loss.  I hope you find peace by helping others. Go âAqueneâs Armyâ!","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"

"That would be the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary & the editors of the OE Thesaurus that produced the aforementioned definitions, not me. It would be the Bundestag that differs on the definitions in a legal perspective, as does our own government.

You're can't even tell the difference between an immigrant and a refugee and yet you expect that I should adhere to your *cough* wisdom? 

Just like on the issue of Trump demographics, I respond with evidence; in this case the very text of German law which proves your claims regarding a lack of limits on immigrants are patently false. You then plead ignorance and claim you'd rather discuss the issue of refugees rather than that of immigrants after pointing out that you are ignorance of the difference between the two.

You can't make this stuff up.","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"
"I am a resident of Grandview-Woodland, living under the dangling sword of renoviction. There's no word yet, but I live in an nearly-50 year-old apartment building, being carefully maintained just above dereliction level. I am 70 years old, in poor health (not because of drugs or alcohol), and my rent consumes 75% of my income. And of course the rent goes up every year. I have no idea where I can go when the eviction comes. I was born and raised in Vancouver. Even if I try to move to the very edge of the Vancouver area â Coquitlam, Mission, and so on, I will not find a home I can afford. Where will I go? How will I live? I am an multiple-award-winning writer/artist, but you know how well that pays. I would like to continue my arts career until I am too old to function, and I would also like to stay in my neighbourhood, and my city, where my friends are. I doubt if I can continue anything at all in the future that looms. A hex upon the greedy developers, and Mayor Robertson, their pal.","0.1666666716337204","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.1666666716337204","0.0","0.0"
"The Flames want free transit to their games for all ticket holders. Contrast that with: No free transit for those going to work. No free transit for those going to school. No free transit for those going to the hospital. No free transit for those going home after a night of one to many. 
As outlandish as that ask is, the Flames also want all revenue from the parking, including unrelated events, like The Stampede. 

The Flames, being the incredibly astute business people they are, should simply buy a piece of land( subject to successful permitting etc), build the facility, and go into business. Any conservative ought to understand that!","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"
"Thank you for the lecture, but request denied. Information is prevalent in the modern world, and in certain instances, a person does something so reprehensible, it is often cathartic for people to respond. Reprehensible like mowing down a kid and leaving them to die. A kid that lived in the neighborhood.
