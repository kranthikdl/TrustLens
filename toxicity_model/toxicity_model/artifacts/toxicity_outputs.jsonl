I was out with friends and we went to the bar in the Driscoll and lo and behold old Jimothy himself was on a couch with his wife, minding their own business, unnoticed in a relatively quiet bar with about 20 other patrons. \n\nBeing full of booze and tact, I promptly said “Holy Fuck, it’s Jim Gaffigan”. He slowly turned to look at me, with a look that said, “really man?” And so I did the only logical thing I could think of. I shot him double finger pistols and walked to the other side of the bar. \n\nImmediately they were inundated with admirers looking for selfies and autographs. I was sitting at the bar with my friends, feeling like a proper ass, while the horde consumed the Gaffigans for a few minutes. My roomate had ordered a white wine, so her boyfriend and I also ordered wine just to be idiots. \n\nWell not five minutes later, after the crowd had satisfied its cruel bloodlust for the Gaffigans attention, who should come sidling up to me at the bar? The great Jim Gaffigan himself. \n\nHe walks right up to me and says, “you know, I’d like to order a wine too, but I’m not a lady.” It was hilarious. \n\nI apologized for blowing up his spot like that and then we actually chatted for about five minutes. Talked about the tour they were on, how his family was doing, standard stuff really. \n\nI recommended a few restaurants they could check out while they were in town, pointed out some hiking trails he could take the kids on. Then we clinked our glasses, wished each other well and he was on his way. \n\nMy friends were looking at me with their mouths wide open, amazed by this surreal experience.

I went to see Living Colour, they were the opening act for Extreme playing at a casino. After the show I got dinner at the casino with my friend and his wife.

He was really cool, thanked me, and shook my hand before getting mobbed by a bunch of fans wanting autographs. My friend’s wife is a big fan and pissed that I got to meet him and she didn’t. \n\nMaybe it is Rush’s Limelight that shaped me, but I never ask for autographs or selfies, and I don’t pretend they are a long awaited friend.

Eventually they had to put locks on all the doors to protect themselves. But everyone always just told them he would grow out of it.\n\nEventually the then 17-year old boy and the mother, who was a professional boxer I think, had a fight that turned physical and she beat him up so much that he couldn’t get up anymore.

{"text": "My SOs sister has 4 babies with her husband, the youngest is 4 months and the oldest is 6. He disappeared to Montana 2 months ago after quitting his 6 figure mine job (guys only half literate) to move his family to Montana to start a church. \n\nProblem is, there’s no rentals available in this podunk 3k population town. And they only realized they’d have no where to live when they’d already loaded up the whole house and family and driven to Utah (where her parents live) from Nevada. \n\nSo, he’s been living in Montana with his younger cousin and her 2 month old. He has made comments in the past about his 19 year old cousins body and boasted to his wife over the phone about how he helped her baby latch by grabbing his cousin’s tit and putting it in babies mouth. \n\nHe keeps claiming that they’ll have a rental and the rest of the family will be able to move up there next month. \n\nCurrently, she and the kids are squatting in his parents basement in Utah, causing my SO’s mentally disadvantaged younger brother to move into the RV in the driveway. His parents are paying all of the costs to feed these 5 people in the basement that have turned their home into a circus and are exacerbating his mother’s health problems. They cannot afford to keep feeding them. My SOs sister hasn’t worked since she dropped out of college at 18 (7 years ago) to marry him. \n\nSo my SOs idiot brother-in-law just called and asked his wife to leave the kids with her parents and come visit him. He’s been working part time in a coffee shop and not paying rent while he lives with his cousin and her infant across town (in Montana) instead of living with his aunt who lives next to the coffee shop. \n\nHe’s been calling around where my SOs parents live asking if anyone will watch their kids for a few days so that his wife can basically go be a booty call real quick while he plays incestuous bachelor under some guise of starting a church. Also, the man is half literate. \n\nHe hasn’t seen his youngest since she was 2 months old (half of her entire life!) but is helping his cousin latch her own 2 month old. \n\nMen are incredible. At this point, his wife is also implicated in being an idiot and refusing to take any action to care for her family. She’s too busy having multiple melt-downs a day and saying stupid shit like how she trusts “that God will reward them when he leads them through these trials.” Meanwhile, everyone but her and her husband are having to mitigate this clusterfuck they created. \n\n(Forgot to mention they’re paying two loans (???) on a vehicle that SO’s BIL unilaterally decided to give away to a man that was in jail for sex crimes against a child. So 1) birds of a feather… and 2) they are BROKE broke.)\n\nShe’s also working to find someone to watch her kids so she can go spend a few days with the husband that quit his high-paying job and abandoned them to backwoods Montana.\n\nTLDR there are men who sacrifice the wellbeing of not only their wives but their 4 very young kids but still prioritize getting their little penis wet.", "labels": ["toxic", "severe_toxic", "obscene", "threat", "insult", "identity_hate"], "probabilities": [0.0051886397413909435, 0.00013595944619737566, 0.000629510497674346, 0.00011891161557286978, 0.00047773862024769187, 0.00026105064898729324], "predictions": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "meta": {"author": "IANALbutIAMAcat", "score": 125, "created_utc": 1761141353.0, "id": "nks2a1i", "link_id": "t3_1od3um2", "parent_id": "t1_nks0rcx", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1od3um2/what_is_the_scariest_post_youve_stumbled_across/nks2a1i/"}}
